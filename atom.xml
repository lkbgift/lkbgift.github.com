    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>I wrote a paper titled &#8220;Soka Education and Digital Education Technologies: Massively Open Online Courses,&#8221; for the 2013 Soka Education Student Research Project conference. The following section is the conclusion.</em></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Soka education’s philosophical framework for teaching and learning is appropriate for the emerging to the newly emerging educational technology field. This papers goal was to help draw attention to a field that is quickly emerging with good intentions. The growth and social cause makes it attractive to both educators, entrepreneurs, and investors. Having such a great impact on the students, it must be carefully traversed. In references to evidence oriented progress, Makiguchi states:> “We must strictly avoid following ideologies of uncertain origin that cannot be substantiated by actual proof-even if they may be the most time-honored tradition-and thereby sacrificing the precious lives of others and ourselves.”The education technologies too must be scrutinized to insure they are being implemented for the correct reasons. While MOOCs and other tools may benefit schools in reducing costs and increasing profits, the fundamental question should revolve around how they improve a students learning opportunity.The digital technologies emerging in the education space are seeking to improve student-centered learning opportunities, but the educational technology space is not new. In the past five years, investors funding emerging private educational technology enterprises has quadrupled. These investments are spurring ventures such as MOOCs, but are still building profit-seeking entities. As a result, the driving forces behind Soka education are invaluable for reflecting on the purpose of education technology companies. Traditionally disruptive technology companies must be extremely careful in their disruption of existing educational markets. While emerging digital technologies can undoubtedly offer value to improving student experiences, many systems are already healthy.The MOOC field is targeted at student-centeredness in a way that is inline with Soka Education. Just as the MOOCs themselves are not innately good or bad, their application must be continually considered. Companies like Udacity and Coursera are already holding classes that are eligible for actual college credit in American universities. The MOOCs are will help colleges reduce the cost of classes, expand course selection for students, and continue growing the discussion on the application of digital technology to education. The digital tools redefine “student-centeredness” by allow students to personalize their learning experiences in ways less prone to budget and institutional capacity. ## Future ResearchFuture research should further analyze the following points from the perspective of Soka education: MOOC course rights, digital resource copyright clearance, hybrid teaching pedagogies, the usage of other multimedia tools for student learning, and the efficacy of video based learning materials. These topics could each be the basis for extensive research to further the field of student-centered education using digital technologies.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>&#8220;The Trial&#8221; Kafka</h1>

<p><em>Starting off with the face that I needed some New York in my life. Digging the people, the architecture, the little coffee shops and busy subways.</em></p>

<h2>First two chapters.</h2>

<p>Kafka writes <strong>The Trial</strong> in a slight mysterious plot line that Im not used to reading. Reading the news and twitter streams has made me expect the core of the manner in a short burst. <strong>The Trial</strong> lays out a plot line by painting a clear picture and scene. The scene is filled with distinct emotional expression and tension, but there are no defined characters or causes. In a buddhist explanation, <strong>The Trial</strong> describes the world through effects, rather than causes.</p>

<h2>Home invasion</h2>

<p>The book begins with an abrupt awakening of the main character. Two men disrupt K. from his morning regime of breakfast and preparing for work. Instead, he is observed and kept from leaving his room. He is arrested.</p>

<p>The arrest is not explained to the reader or the main character and unfolds into the dangers of a hierarchical authority system. The figures arresting K. do not know why he is being arrested, but feel quite justified in their restriction of K.&#8217;s freedom. The invasion of privacy, disruption of personal space, and disregard for another&#8217;s humanity is seen in so many facets of society. The authority figures are not alone in their expression.</p>

<p>K., who hopes to reclaim his dignity, seeks answers. After being detained in his own home, he encounters the figure of higher command who personally interview the detainee. K., who continues seeking the cause for the injustices of the morning, encounters yet another response absent of reason. The invading figures freely roam K.&#8217;s home and declare their departure.</p>

<h2>Court appearance</h2>

<p>Forced to face his day without comprehending the complete background of the morning&#8217;s events, K. braves the rest of his day at work. Left only with a notion that he is expected to appear in court, he is forced to make assumptions as to his appearance date. Again, lacking all information to help understand the situation, K. decides to make his way to the courts on the first potential day court gathers.</p>

<p>Finding his way to the courthouse is no simple task. K. wanders the neighborhood and buildings near the courthouse, hoping to glimpse upon the place of his belonging. K. discovers the courthouse only too late and is forced to stand trial the moment of his arrival. Again, no explanation, he is placed in front of, what seems to be a divided courthouse.</p>

<p>Giving his all, K. argues for the injustices he is forced to undergo. Again, little understanding behind the disruption&#8217;s cause makes the argument one of unwarranted personal invasion.</p>

<h2>Realm of foreign rules</h2>

<p>Throughout K.&#8217;s series of events, the reader is left to wonder how easily the same events could happen to themselves. K. is a everyday well respected citizen. There is little that he did to provoke these events. More so, he seems to do everything in proper order to understand the dilemma, but is given no regard.</p>

<p>Replace K.&#8217;s story with any individual, young or old, and <strong>The Trial</strong> reflects their own experience in a judicial system. When expected to defend oneself in a realm of foreign rules, it matters little that there is any reason at all. The senselessness of the book&#8217;s plot captures closely the &#8220;in the moment&#8221; activity one is forced to experience in any mode of heavy jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The digestion of events is difficult in foreign systems of operation. More so, in moments of extreme consequence, the notion of clear reflection is nearly impossible.</p>

    <link href="http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/02/06/moocs/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-06T17:52:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/02/06/moocs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Massively Open Online Classes</h1>

<p>One of the exciting innovations for education is the Massively Open Online Classrooms that colleges around the world have begun to offer. While the idea of online classes or distance learning is not a new phenomena, the process of using well recognized brand name schools to widely distribute lessons is new. Companies such as edX, Coursera, as well as a number of other private companies are striking partnerships with colleges to offer their courses online. The partnership universities, such as Harvard, MIT, and Berkeley, are offering completely free courses to anybody with an internet connection. These courses are a compilation of recorded lectures, quizzes, and assignments. The lectures are sometimes actual recorded in-class lectures, from the hosting university. Other times, courses are recorded solely for the purpose of the MOOC course. The method of distribution raises questions of how beneficial the MOOCs are for student’s learning experience.</p>

<h2>University&#8217;s motivation</h2>

<p>The motivation behind universities developing online courses are not always the same as the motivations behind students seeking quality education. While presently, the popularly acclaimed MOOCs are offering completely free courses, there is no question that future profit motives exist. A university’s costs incurred for holding a online class is exponentially smaller than that of a actual classroom. The value created by a teacher is expanded when effectively able to teach tens and thousands of students rather than hundreds. Additionally, the number of students a teacher is able to serve is no longer restricted per the classroom size. Oppositely, this shift in the ability for a teacher to be free of classroom size restrictions may be the balance needed to help improve teacher salaries. The ability for a teacher to teach a larger group of students can allow teachers to be paid respective to the teaching ability. Regardless of the motivation, the practices used by these online courses have historically not been equivalent to in-class lectures or lessons.</p>

<h2>The pedagogy behind MOOCs</h2>

<p>The MOOC courses are currently based on pedagogically proven methods to engage the student in online learning environments. The online video lecture classes are interspersed with quizzes between topics, evaluating if students understood the core content as they are learning. Additionally, contrary to popular belief, the online courses encourage student interaction in the classes. Discussions, peer-grading, as well as in-class group projects are common parts of the classes. Learning platforms, such as Coursera and edX have created discussion threads for every quiz. The discussion threads allow students who do not understand a quiz to ask questions, while more experienced students can help answer the questions.</p>

<h2>Social aspect</h2>

<p>While the courses themselves are taken alone, they are not completely socially isolated. The opportunity for discussion spurs vibrant conversations based on the lecture content. In an attempt to reduce the isolation of online classes, the courses encourage students to engage with the classmates, rather than passively listening to the lecture. Similarly, nearly all the courses held by Stanford, on the Coursera system, require students to complete group projects for full class credit. The group projects require students to connect with other classmates, based on geographic proximity, and collaborate on a class topic related project. These various modes of quizzing, discussion boards, and in-person class projects are applying a variety of effective pedagogical methods to the online platfor.</p>

<h2>Comparing to alternatives</h2>

<p>Online learning compared to in-class or one-to-one tutoring raises questions of viability. While the method of one-on-one teacher is definitely of greater value to a student, it is many times an experience reserved for the few. gmailFalling costs of government subsidies for schools and growing number of students seeking to enter higher education are reducing the number of quality learning opportunities available for the majority of students. As a result, the question behind alternative to the one-to-one or small classroom learning experiences are natural. Without claiming that online classrooms are equal, we can confidently state that the value behind online classrooms is a question worth researchig.</p>

<h2>Drive to hybrid</h2>

<p>Online courses seek to discover and implement the highest quality teaching experiences. In 2010, the United States Department of Education issued a detailed report showing that online learning methods are, on average, at least as effective as face-to-face learning. The online courses seek to overcome the problem where students forget the concepts not learned because they do not review the content. By providing students with immediate feedback, through quizzes, students know whether or not they understood a concept. The method, referred to as Mastery Learning, was one of the methods shown in a seminal paper seeking to provide students in group learning environments a learning experience equal to that of one-to-one tutoring. Grounded in proven methods of pedagogy, the online courses and providers are seeking out teaching methods that are known to be the most effective for students. This could be thought of as a scientifically proven student-centered method.</p>

    <link href="http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/02/02/how-to-hackathon/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-02T11:45:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/02/02/how-to-hackathon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>The state of Hackathon-ing</h1>

<p><em>Last week I attended a Hackathon put on by Google&#8217;s Youtube and GTV team. I was introduced to the event through GOOD Magazine&#8217;s Coding for Good project. While I was not directly participating with GOOD, I ended up working closely with their team members. This Hackathon was particularly different from the other two I have attended. Mainly, there were a lot more engineers and interest in building a product (rather than a business).</em></p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/dX0FPPq.png" alt="Mindmap from our group" /></p>

<h2>Why attend?</h2>

<p>Most Hackathon&#8217;s involve a business organizing developers for a prize. The prize is given to the developer(s) who produce a project that is determined to best fit the event&#8217;s criteria. The company organizing the events often provides general information about the event, so that developers can learn a bit about the API&#8217;s and technologies expected to be used. While the API research can be valuable, the Hackathon&#8217;s will often have support from the API maintainers. This means you can get hard questions answered and have your questions directed to the write place.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>The beginning of every Hackathon I&#8217;ve been to starts with a bit of networking. After the networking there is a short explanation by the organizers about what is expected throughout the event. Finally, there is a period of time for participants to pitch a project idea to an audience. The period for pitching is normally very short, requiring the pitchers to condense their project idea into a easy to understand statement.</p>

<p>Once all the pitches are completed (or the time allotted for pitches is exhausted), participants make their way to learn more about the projects pitched. In most cases, people show up to the even without a project in mind, so they need to join a group. Additionally, not all people who pitch a project will have a group to organize.</p>

<p>The groups that succeed in developing a group are often clear projects that can be completed in a short period of time. More so, the leader of the group must have some clarity on where the project is expected to go, what the group requires to be successful, and how to get a group of strangers to work together.</p>

<p>Once groups have formed and projects are defined, the group begins hashing out the work to do for the weekend. Often a pitch can be vague and undeveloped. Other times the pitch may make assumptions about the capacity of one weekend of hacking. As a result, the refining period is used to redefine the project based on the groups developer talent.</p>

<p>The next phase is the longest. The group gets down and dirty to build the product they discussed. The building process requires research, design, application, testing, and deployment. The rest of the event is intended to get a group as far along as possible in building their product.</p>

<p>The Hackathon is meant to launch good ideas into minimum viable products. This means the product itself doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. It doesn&#8217;t even need to fully work. Instead, the project just needs to do the most basic function that your group wants to focus on. As the project is judged based on a short judge-demo, the project can have its smoke and mirrors to create the perception of a working project.</p>

<h1>Tips for attendees.</h1>

<h2>1. You don&#8217;t need to know anyone.</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry. Not knowing anyone at the Hackathon is one of the best parts of the event. Sure you can show up with your fellow developer friends (which not everyone has), but you don&#8217;t need to worry about that. By showing up to the event, you are assuring yourself that you will make great connections with fellow group members. So, first point: don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t know anyone but want to attend. You will meet people and make good friends.</p>

<h2>2. Refine your pitch into one sentence</h2>

<p>Refining your pitch into one sentence means simplifying it. When you explain the idea to people, you have to convince them to work with you. More so, you have to know what you can do in one weekend. Think through your idea and figure out how to cut out any parts that are unnecessary for its ability to prove its viability. Don&#8217;t focus on periphery functions. Make sure the product does what you say its going to do and nothing more. If you want more, worry about that after your team is bug-free.</p>

<h2>3. Pick a subject for your project ahead of time</h2>

<p>When you are pitching an idea, you will be standing in front of a crowd of people you don&#8217;t know. No matter how many times you have done this, you will feel a bit nervous. This is normal. Just do what you can to refine your idea ahead of time and don&#8217;t try to &#8216;wing-it&#8217;.
Its best if you can put some time in before the event to refine an idea. Its good to have a few ideas, because the ideas will change anyway. The important point is that you identify the subject of your idea. Once you pick that, you can figure out how to execute the idea later.
People who join your group will not necessarily understand the functionality of your product. Instead, you will be selling the importance of your subject matter and attract people who have also thought about the problem.</p>

<h2>4. Give out a simple way to contact you during any broadcast opportunities (pitch, pre-event idea board, etc)</h2>

<p>If you get the chance to post your idea in a area that is public to the participants, make sure to provide contact information! Imagine if you are reading a list of ideas and are very interested in one of them, but don&#8217;t know how to get ahold of the group leader. Instead, someone who is sitting near you at the event asks you what you do, and then convinces you to join their group. You don&#8217;t want this to happen.
Give out your phone number, twitter handle, or what ever you use when pitching your idea. Also make sure to leave with a note about where you are sitting and how to find you. Its too often that participants are listening to a stream of ideas and even if they liked what you said, they forgot about it and don&#8217;t know how to find you.</p>

<h2>5. Use visual tools when describe your idea in a small group</h2>

<p>The more articulate you can be about an idea, the better. There are countless reasons for this, but mainly it will help you refine your ideas. When making a mind map (I love using MindNode Pro), you start to see the functional relations between your idea and their dependencies.
More so, when you visualize your idea, you can be sure your group understands what the project is. Theres nothing worse then having worked on a project for a day and realizing the everyone in the group doesn&#8217;t exactly know what is being built. To prevent this, have a sit down period where you visually layout what is expected out of your idea. This will come in handy later, so people can voluntarily pick up sections of the project to complete.</p>

<h2>6. Build your project in small but complete parts</h2>

<p>Rather then trying to build tons of separate parts that come together at the end, try to build your project in small but functional parts. If you have a process that your project depends on (parsing information, calling an API, displaying the content, getting feedback, etc.), make sure the parts are able to function on their own. Seeing groups work on a project for a weekend, then not being able to get done with the &#8220;one part&#8221; they needed to get it online is horrible.
If you build a project, try to have each part be presentable in itself. Having those parts come together and function together is your end goal, but worst case you have parts of the project you can show. Remember, you just need to convince the judges that the idea is viable.</p>

<h2>7. Pair program if your team can handle it</h2>

<p>Having two people work on a part of the application at a time is an efficient way to make sure you are making constant progress. I have seen myself get stuck on a problem for 2-3 hours, when it would have been something easy for another person to resolve. Oppositely, I&#8217;ve seen people get stuck on design elements which would have taken me a couple minutes to mock up properly.
By combining forces on development, you can make sure your group makes steady progress. This also means your team members will not get caught up figuring out how to integrate another persons code. While working as individuals may feel productive, as soon as integration issues pop-up, you take away from both people making any progress.</p>

<h2>8. Make friends with other participants</h2>

<p>Most importantly, the point of a Hackathon (for the participants) is to have fun. Only one group is going to win the big prize, but anyone can network. Personally, I love meeting the participants who enjoy coming out to these events and spend a weekend learning something new.</p>

<h2>9. Ask questions!!!</h2>

<p>Also, a great way to learn new technologies is by doing. The best way is by teaching. There are certain to be people who are learning new technologies themselves and would love to teach you for the sake of defining their own understandings. Never be afraid to ask other people to teach and help you with your issues. Even if they are in a competing group.</p>

    <link href="http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/01/24/proposal-for-you-to-write-a-Soka-education-paper/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-24T03:57:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/01/24/proposal-for-you-to-write-a-Soka-education-paper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Participate in researching Soka education</h2>

<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, write a paper for the Soka education conference. Looking into the past few years of conference books, you will see that there are two commonalities: people are understanding the core concepts of Soka education and they have a very unique perspective of applying their field of knowledge.</p>

<p>Many of the papers written on Soka education have a common part explaining Makiguchi&#8217;s value system and his past. This is hugely important because in itself, Soka education&#8217;s philosophy is not unique. The values it holds are present in countless other institutions around the world. What separates this philosophy from others is its unique roots and the consequential following development of the Soka Gakkai. It is safe to say, if it was not for Josei Toda and Daisaku Ikeda, Makiguchi&#8217;s name would not be remembered today.</p>

<h2>Your perspective is important</h2>

<p>It is also safe to say that as a unique individual who has an important perspective on the world, you would greatly contribute to this field by exploring the relation of your knowledge and those who have come before. In 2013, Soka education is young. There are texts to still be fully translated and widely published. Similarly, there are plenty of ideas which have not yet been explored.</p>

<p>The beauty of Soka is its broad applicability to all subjects. The creation of value is subjective and thus universally applicable. Regardless your interest and the depth of your understanding, the process of exploring Soka education (or any field of niche study for that matter) will benefit you greatly.</p>

<p>Once certain outcome in your exploration of this subject is that you will undoubtedly learn more about your own field. Of course you will learn more about Soka education, Makiguchi, Ikeda, and the Soka school system. More so, you will have to question your own knowledge in reference to that of a new lens. The experiment of viewing your own domain from that of a value creative perspective is difficult. Difficult, but undeniably valuable for your own sake.</p>

<p>If you find yourself growing stagnant in your field, review your field in the light of Soka. You won&#8217;t regret it. Oh and unlike me, turn it in on time.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-18T10:22:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/01/18/relearning-education</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trying to understand what is important in a foreign industry is difficult. The last two weeks, I&#8217;ve done my best immersing myself in the educator and web developer communities. My goal: understand how I can contribute to a market I felt was missing its modern touch.</p>

<p>Recent publications, such as EdSurge, and a increased organization effort in the edutech market - aka conferences and hackathons - caught my attention. Backed with a self taught background in web development and a semi-guided exposure to educational institutions and learning, I decided I would commit myself to this industry.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Web development is a craft and an obsession. Its takes effort to stay un-to-date with the current of technologies. It takes time to wrap your head around the tools available and the languages used. For some, their networks of colleagues and friends make this process easy, but I have found myself grabbing and absorbing everything available.</p>

<p>What started as an effort to make a few dollars without working on an hourly wage led to a full fledged effort to making a career of web development. After proceeding from a few Craigslist posts, to Odesk jobs, an in-person freelance clients, and finally a legitimate corporate hired position I realized this stuff clicks.</p>

<p>Spending time working in a corporation gave me two realizations. One, I could do this for a long time and save a lot of money. The money was good, the time felt meaningful, and the problems to solve were literally endless. Secondly, being given a specific responsibility and task meant that I would become an expert in my field, but my field only.</p>

<p>These two points left me torn. Was I meant to become an expert in UX development and pull in paycheck after paycheck - stressing over the minute details - or find something that I didn&#8217;t completely understand but could justify being passionate about. I am choosing the latter.</p>

<h2>Getting up to speed</h2>

<p>I studied at Soka University of America as a liberal arts student concentrating in the Humanities. Exactly what this means I was supposed to learn, Im not sure.</p>

<p>I came away feeling passionate about communication technologies and their social consequences. As McLuhan says, &#8220;The medium is the message.&#8221; Neuro-imaging experts studying the brain on the internet will tell you the same.</p>

<p>Within the educational sector, I was drawn in by the aligning of my experience in college and the tone of the media I have been consuming. Frequently I am introduced to new conflicting arguments about technologies &#8216;disrupting&#8217; modern educational institutions.</p>

<p>What started as my introduction to complaints about the soon-to-collapse derivative market around student loans developed into a focus on technical training for the work place. In my shift from a television watcher to a RSS feed reader, I saw for-profit technical training institutions shift from certificate programs to course-by-course online sessions.</p>

<p>Fast-forwarding to 2013, massively open online courses introduce college credits available through online platforms. While this is technically the same as distance learning programs that colleges already offered, the quality is increasing. My serious interest began here.</p>

<p>Following, I sought opportunities to meet people who were in the industry I understood to be socially meaningful. Conferences, meet-ups, occasional stranger emails, and rapid academic journal consumption provided a scaffold of knowledge to get me up to speed.</p>

<h2>Motivating factors</h2>

<p>My current interest initiated from the startup world&#8217;s success. In my own eyes, seeing single digit person companies pop-up and sellout in one year product cycle, with a cash out of over 100 million dollars a person is ridiculous. Software development is the investment banking of our time. Twenty-somethings with motivation, technical foresight, and social know-how are building and selling companies in ways that were not possible in the past.</p>

<p>Shifting from probability of economic success to value based analysis, education seemed like the next step. Soka education, a driving principal and reoccurring point of discussion at my undergraduate university was my frame of reference. Tech startups are looking at producing solutions to problems that are otherwise left alone. Soka education provides me a vanishing point toward which I should work toward.</p>

<p>Policy, investment and funding opportunities, technological developments, and most of all a change in values has increased the attention toward educational tech entrepreneurs in the past two years. I am curious what truly caused the attention toward are market that has otherwise been unchanged for a hundred and some years.</p>

<p>The ways of teaching themselves have not changed. The accessibility to technology has not completely shifted. The budgets and product cycles have not completely shifted. Still, the valley and its fellow tech hubs are driving attention to the edutech market.</p>

<h2>Public appeal</h2>

<p>The mass coverage regarding the spots of success have been unbalanced (as usual). Ventures driven by individual success stories littered the headlines for months. Khan Academy being a key example. Shifting from individual content providers to the mass of videos freely accessible through YouTube, the newly available forms multi-media are shifting the worlds view of learning.</p>

<p>Technical programs targeting aspiring programmers and engineers were highlighted in the emergence of Codecademy. Accessibility to college level courses were made public through the hundred thousand person MOOC courses held by the top university brands from around the world. Quality and scalable education were seen as becoming a paired concept.</p>

<p>Resistance in public form followed. Outrage toward the replacement of teachers appeared in the opinion section of major publications. Parents feared teachers would no longer teach. Teachers felt their jobs were not replaceable. Students were provided access to resources in complete form that were previously kept for individuals proven to be capable of understanding their contents.</p>

<p>Einstein, Feynman, as well as countless other geniuses intellectually advanced beyond their peers because of access to information. Imagine the potential of young aspiring minds exposed to the height of university lectures and resources. Not only do these students have access, but they have the ability to participate in discussions.</p>

<h2>Structuring opportunities</h2>

<p>The discussion surrounding educational tech companies and the issues in schools do not perfectly match up. Replacing teachers with computers is far from the answer. On the other hand, the utilization of modern tools is invaluable. Teachers who can navigate through modern media have a plethora of tools available to them.</p>

<p>Increased expectation and a unchanged variable of time leaves classrooms budging with ideas but restricted in the ability to execute. This is where tech companies come in. Data driven learning, personalization (not the plopping in front of a computer, but the real kind), active learning, real-time assessment and feedback, increased parent-teacher communication, early intervention, are but some of the potential points of applying technology in classrooms.</p>

<p>These technologies must reduce the effort to operate and remove all possible friction to assist teachers. The designs must be intuitive, the data flexible, and the usage made across platforms. Too easy is it to feel like you are solving a perceived problem without validation of correctly doing so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Continuing MediaX</h1>

<p><em>Everyday there is more things to learn and share, so I need to quickly get through these MediaX notes.</em></p>

<p>Paulo Blikstein talked about the crisis of students who don&#8217;t care about science in math. By first grade 70% of students have no interest in science. By the 7th grade, the sample of students who self report shrinks to less than 10%. This is a leading sign of what our economy will be like in the coming years.</p>

<p>He explains that our schools are not places that support science and math learning. If we want to teach swimming, we build a swimming pool. For science education, we are not creating an environment that fits the learning process. We don&#8217;t have the swimming pools for science.</p>

<p>Stanford is creating a program that transforms one room in a school and fits it with the necessary tools to engage students through making. This is the experience they need to feel like they want to learn science. Beyond learning who Leonardo Divinci is, they do what he did using 3d printers and circuits.</p>

<p>The program is called the Fablab and its focus is creating an environment where students can apply what they learn to their own lives. These programs are in countries around the world and not limited to affluent communities. That being said, the percent of students who can benefit from these opportunities are much smaller than the number of students in school.</p>

<h2>Shortening the geographical divide</h2>

<p>Renate Fruchter talked about improving global teamwork. The question is: How can we capitalize on the core competency in a global corporate structure to communicate beyond space and time. The group PBL Labs is using a mixed media reality platform to have real time 3d collaboration between digital space.</p>

<p>The program recognizes Face-to-face is the best communication, but is not always possible. As individuals, we are wired for feedback, so we need to create systems of communication that allow us to communicate beyond face-to-face.</p>

<p>There were six statements that this model assumes are needed: I know where I am, I know where you are, we know where we are, we know where we want to go, we know where we can go, we move.</p>

<h2>Brain patterns and the mind</h2>

<p>This talk is a bit scary. Brain scans can be used to identify if you recognize something or whether it is the first time for you to be exposed to stimulation. Technology use on neuro-cognitive function can scan the brain to see what parts of your cortex fire. Using brain imaging technology and machine learning algorithms, the brain can be analyzed for real world interaction.</p>

<p>The ability to monitor memory does not require human beings to know exactly what touch points in the brain are being active. Instead, machine learning patterns can be used to look for similarities in the processes associated with learning. When a process of learning occurs, it is different than a process of status. This means changes in the brains ability to see something new and recognize something old can be identified.</p>

<p>The decoding can be used to see whether a person recognizes a face. These reports can be near perfect. You can apply this for forensic implications, use it for commercial purposes, and understand the state of being a person believes they are in.</p>

<p>The brain can also be understood to see if people think they are in a certain place. Using video games, people are stimulated to perceive themselves in a game. This means, they are mentally projecting themselves in a different &#8216;place&#8217;. The fact that the information about a person&#8217;s believed &#8216;location&#8217; can be tracked has huge implications.</p>

<p>Emotional wellbeing, psychological status, false systems of logic, and insanity are literally measurable. If a person feels alone or constructs a reality in which they are in a &#8216;different&#8217; place, neuro imaging can visualize this.</p>

<p>The patterns still have improvement opportunities, but this raises many questions of ethics and privacy. When you can show up in court to have a brain scan which reports whether or not you recognize a witness, we will be in a very different state of authority and operation.</p>

<h2>Schools are poor</h2>

<p>Roy Pea talked about the educational system. Schools are poor. Graduation rates are horrible. The Bill and Melinda gates foundation has a 17 year goal of having a 70% high school graduation rate in the United States. This is optimistic. Right now, 7/10 people do not graduate from college. Thats a 30% rate of elementary school students who will actually make it into college. Thats 30% of people who have an opportunity to develop a language to understand and express the world in a shared academic construct.</p>

<p>Roy talks about the points we can design differently. To start, students in the K-12 school system spent <em>1 million minutes</em> in school. These classes with long seating time and lecture based teaching with paper textbooks are not effective. We get very little data from students apart from midterms and final grades. People in every class are creating data, but the amount of feedback that a teacher gets to direct a students learning is minimal. This needs to change.</p>

<p>The department of education published a report in 2012 declaring a technology plan for education. The vision is very different from what we have now. The plan states learning can take advantage of an always on world. The always on can mean always creating (data) and always learning (consuming). Using mobile powered technology, theres opportunities for a single teacher to transmit to all students.</p>

<p>Student centered methods of learning need to be taught. Not just to students, but to teachers, administrators, parents, and communities. We can have student centered learning through the tools we have available to us today. We need to develop systems that support these tools and have individuals who are trained in mentoring and coaching people toward authoritative goals. The goal is life long learning and we can have this through the available learning tools.</p>

<p>We can have learning related to school in and out of the classroom. As American&#8217;s, our school system has one of the smallest times in the classroom. We can extend the learning time, even with this. The national plan can have changes applied to the school structure. It can give teachers better tools to apply visual learning opportunities.</p>

<p>Right now, math and science levels drop over the summer for low income students. New services can increase student learning time out of the class through games. The plan to connect America through broadband internet can be a national plan to improve the opportunities to access learning materials. This would transform American education through learning powered technology.</p>

<p>Shortlist of points: education analytics will be important, US department of education declared adoption of technology, personalized adaptive learning pathways using data trails, utilization of mobile devices, out of the classroom learning opportunities, personalized learning goals…<strong>personalization</strong> is the key.</p>

<p>Grand challenge #1: Design and validate an integrate system that provides realtime access to learning experiences tuned to the levels of difficulty and assistance that optimize learning for all learners, and that incorporates self-improiving features that enable it to become increasingly effective thtourgh interaction learning.</p>

    <link href="http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/01/09/talks-about-education/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-09T20:46:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/01/09/talks-about-education</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>I attended, MediaX</h1>

<p>Held at Stanford university to share emerging academic research. <em>The notes from the MediaX talks can be found <a href="http://pastebin.com/9xbqCS3H">here</a>.</em> I suggest copying the content and moving them to your favorite editor.</p>

<p>The opening was given by Claude Steele, a scholar of Stereotype Threat. Claude&#8217;s opening emphasized the changes in the research that come about from looking at connections between concentrations of study. He gave an example of psychology since the implementation of the MRI brain scan. Prior to image scanning, psychology was a measurement of behavior (subjective and inconsistent). MRI imaging transformed the industry by creating new opportunities to measure (quantitatively and objectively) and establishing a new language for explaining a powerful science.</p>

<h2>Interpersonal interaction coding.</h2>

<p>The first talk by Mark Schar analyzed productivity, creativity, and group dynamics between &#8220;divergers&#8221; and &#8220;convergers&#8221;. Divergers were described as people would questioned one another to find new answers. Convergers were oppositely seen as people who agreed with the rest of a group.</p>

<p>The study looked at how people collaborated, by calculating the pace at which questions were asked and new ideas were presented. The study clearly showed a distinction between two separate groups (composed on only one type). The pace of <em>ideas were expressed by diveregers at a rapid pace in the beginning</em> and a bit slower in the middle. <em>The convergers had a slow start </em>to discuss ideas, then near the middle exchanged ideas and slowed down again at the end. The important point is to have both groups together when constructing teams.</p>

<p>The goal of the study was to understand and code interaction-dynamics between individuals working together in groups. The result was understanding that regardless of the type of people, <em>the most important thing was to insure that no &#8220;blocks&#8221; were created during discussion.</em> As long as no blocks existed, the group continued to look for alternatives in approaching the situation.</p>

<p>Greg Kress studied how to predict long term team performance based on personalities. Study showed that all 17 factors studied are important, but one specific point was significantly correlated with innovation and creativity. <em>People who were extraverted in expressing their feelings created a better team dynamic and design.</em></p>

<p>Johnathan Edelman looked at how to influence media and how media influences people. ()Im not exactly sure how this was translated to the evidence below) Edelman studied two groups interaction to see how their behavior would be in a radical design process. The result showed groups that had extraverted physically expressive emotionally involved individuals were identified as the ones who would contribute more to a group. These individuals were seen to <em>gesture more than others</em>.</p>

<h2>Marketing strategies</h2>

<p>Ramesh Johari, professor in management science and engineers looked at how markets can be engineered. He looked at the variables important on influencing exchange in a online market place.</p>

<p>When looking at a market we ask &#8216;who can we trade with&#8217;, &#8216;who are our competitors&#8217; and &#8216;how much should we charge&#8217;. These questions are difficult to answer because of the limited amount of information provided to us in determining the answer. The rise of online market platforms change our ability to make these decisions.</p>

<p>Two important points of platforms are: Fine-grained <em>matching of market participants</em> and fine-grained <em>collection of information about matches</em>. In other words, transparency and centralization.</p>

<p>Market designers, like Uber, centralize the marketplace around their control. You request a ride, but don&#8217;t have a choice between who to select. Once you make a request, Uber opaquely decides who will serve you.</p>

<p>Oppositely, Ebay or Odesk are very decentralized and allow the use all the access to make the best decision. Still, because there are so many options, the decision is influenced by factors of search, rating, history and filtering.</p>

<p>Both decentralization and centralization, opacity and transparency have its benefits. <em>Decentralization is powerful when the platform does not know what the best match for the user will be. Centralization is best in the opposite situation when the platform knows what is best for the user.</em></p>

<p>Opaque markets can also be beneficial in crowded markets. Traditionally economics states that having more choice allows for the market to make the best decision. Instead, in a &#8220;web 3.0&#8221; world where there is too much information, it is not always obvious to know what to choose. (i.e. taobao). <em>Having too much information and not enough can both be negative.</em></p>

<p>The big questions are how do you know how to price these market items and how much information do you need to release. A project describing this issue is looking at the pricing of mobile apps and the variables that influence the purchase of these products. When the question regarding the best marketing strategy, visibility is the most important variable in competitive atmospheres.</p>

<h2>Academic publication meta-coding</h2>

<p>John Willinsky and Alex Garnet talked technically about providing an effective markup structure to existing PDF journals. The focus was kill the PDA and establish a constant method for automating the parsing and rendering of scholarly materials. The benefit of a good markup is that your document becomes your metadata. You don&#8217;t need a well coded abstract, but instead the document itself contains all the content available for understanding the contents.</p>

<p>Reasons: Markup is expensive when someone needs to manually markup the document. Especially for small publishers, it can be very expensive to manually tag existing documents. As a result, having a system to systematically parsing existing content is valuable.</p>

<p>PDF doesn&#8217;t have well-structured text mining and indexing. It also goes against current patterns of data storage, in that it does not have a way to render in different formats on mobile platforms. This prevents dynamic content from being loaded into the documents. <em>(Imagine having a up to date graph in your content while reading a journal)</em></p>

<p><strong>Links</strong>: Although I don&#8217;t know how this will help, some of the programs/services used in developing this software was: <a href="http://aye.comp.nus.edu.sg/parsCit">ParsCit</a>, <a href="http://bibtex.org">BitTex</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF/X">PDFx</a>, <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs_plugins">OJS Plugins</a>, <a href="http://crossref.org">CrossRef</a>, and <a href="http://lib.umich.edu/mpach">mPach</a>.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-07T10:56:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2013/01/07/traveling-to-meet-and-learn</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FpETP.png" title="New Mexico, Texas, the Bay Area, Detroit, New York, Boston, and Washington DC" alt="My trip" /></p>

<h1>Enter US</h1>

<p>I returned back to the US on December 24th (approximately two weeks ago). I overcame a week of jet-lag, where I was waking up at 4 AM every morning and going to bed by 8pm. Not such a bad habit if you ask me. Before returning, I decided I was going to do a bit of traveling in the US, knowing that I was going to bunker down in Orange County, while finishing up some remaining school tasks. I planned a trip to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FpETP.png">New Mexico, Texas, the Bay Area, Detroit, New York, Boston, and Washington DC</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, I have no idea why I planned the trip. I had some places that I knew I wanted to visit (Im looking at you Detroit), but no concrete reasons or goals. I sort of decided that I needed to look at jobs, I needed to reintroduce myself to cities in the US after being China for a year, and finally I needed to see friends.</p>

<p>Immediately after getting into Aliso Viejo, I thought I had caught a cold. The opposite timezones threw off my internal clock. I decided I needed to get a jumpstart on acclimating to US life and started a process of reaching out to old clients and meeting new web developers.</p>

<p>My first step started in China. I used Reddit&#8217;s /r/webdev community to start asking people if they were interested in partnering to work together on projects. I was up at 3am trying to finalize some client work when I decided it would be a good idea to look for co-workers. The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/14ztvk/anyone_interested_in_working_together/">result</a> was surprising. I had respondents from Japan, Ireland, and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Being the internet, I did my best to create a concrete bond beyond a Reddit comment. I got skype/email contact information and started coordinating some direct contact. The Japan and Ireland connections were both quite experienced web developers in their field. On was a designer (Ireland) and the other a security expert (Japan).</p>

<p>The user from Los Angeles was most interesting, because he was the one I was most likely to meet. Los Angeles connection was a PHP developer and offered to meet when I arrived back in the US.</p>

<p><img src="http://new.tinygrab.com/c00843a9616ff8c5ede1b40f097fb25b2a7699985a.png" title="Wordpress developers?" alt="Reddit post /r/webdev" /></p>

<h1>Networking through Reddit</h1>

<p>I met Dan Morgan the third day I returned from China. Not being able to drive, my father graciously took time to drive me up to LA. I met with Dan over dinner, where I promised to cover the tab in exchange for his time.</p>

<p>My goal was to get as much exposure to the developer community in Los Angeles. I was looking to justify my interest in being a front-end developer in Los Angeles, as well as look for some validation in my experience in China. Having been out of the country and never apart of the professional web development community in California (or the US), I felt meeting people already in the field was the best step.</p>

<p>My conversation with Dan started out with him trying to guide me in the right direction. I was looking for what organizations I should watch out for, what meet ups I should be looking to join, and where I would be most efficient at meeting people who valued the work I had to offer. Dan answered my questions by guiding me to looking into the design firm Huge. He also alluded to the fact that there was a inflated value toward UX designers in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Our conversation quickly shifted to how we could be mutually useful to one another. First I understood that he had personal projects of his own (as most developers should/do). I also was able to validate my own experience in China by realizing that not all people had experience with the LEAN startup methodology. More so, I realized that my experience organizing tech meet-ups and events was a valuable experience that would be useful in the context of networking.</p>

<p>Overall Dan was very enlightening. He made me realize there are different kinds of developers. To be blunt, people like Dan are very talented but not aware of the many opportunities around. Dan is the type of person would look for an easy solution available to making money. He was not interested in working hard for someone else&#8217;s idea.</p>

<p>This attitude was not because Dan was lazy, but because he was tired of developing other people&#8217;s ideas without being properly rewarded. I saw this in some sense a result of being jaded by the community. This showed me that if I continue to do work for others, I need to enter contracts/relationships with the understanding that I need to cover my bases from the beginning. Rather than expecting to be rewarded in the future for work in the past, I need to make sure I am rewarded in the present.</p>

<p><img src="http://new.tinygrab.com/c00843a961ee8fcc05cfbfc0a80a5ece6ef38842c6.png" title="Reddit post in /r/Arizona" alt="Reddit to the rescue" /></p>

<h2>Reddit to the rescue (again)</h2>

<p>Next step, I drove to New Mexico with Ryan. We decided to go the scenic route through the native American reservations in Arizona. Our route took us through parts of Arizona where we didn&#8217;t know anybody. We needed a place to sleep, but  were also keeping to a restricted budget.</p>

<p>Our trip began on New Years day and we were going to need to find a place to stay on that evening. We expected to be in Flagstaff or Sedona Arizona (approximately 400 miles from our final destination). Also, little did we know that the nightly temperature was below 0 degrees fahrenheit. This meant no sleeping in the car.</p>

<p>On December 31st, I <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/15qsmr/can_anyone_in_flagstaff_host_my_friend_and_i_for/">posted</a> on the /r/Arizona sub-reddit that we were looking for a place to stay on the night of the first. To my pleasant surprise, a redditor took up the  call to host myself and my friend. Mind you, complete strangers.</p>

<p>Zach, in all his willingness, was okay with us coming to his house at 11pm (our expected arrival time). He gave us his room (where he had a couch and bed) and told us to make ourselves at home. We met for no more than 5 minutes, because he had to be up for work the next morning at 5am. He even left before we woke up in the morning, so by the time we left, we never even got to say bye.</p>

<p>I am extremely grateful for his willingness to host us. Ryan and I left a small gift (a book, photos, and chocolates) to say thanks. Apart from some text message exchanges, we didn&#8217;t otherwise communicate. Before leaving, Ryan and I cleaned up the room. We tried to leave the place cleaner than when we arrived.</p>

<p>Overall, loving the network opportunities coming from Reddit. Highly recommend it to others looking to connect with new job markets or looking for places to live!</p>

    <link href="http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/waterfall-development-sucks/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-20T09:25:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2012/12/20/waterfall-development-sucks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is for the people who need to hire developers, but don&#8217;t understand how to make a website. This is for the person who doesn&#8217;t know where to start, but knows what they don&#8217;t want. In fact, this is perfect for the person who knows what they don&#8217;t want and also has an idea of what they would like.</p>

<p>As a developer, being able to build what the clients needs (and not just what they want) is the sign of success. Sure, I could build a site with the newest technology to impress my friends and fatten my portfolio, but this ignores what I&#8217;m being paid to do. Im being paid to insure the client&#8217;s company is successful and effective in establishing a digital facing extension.</p>

<p>Designing and programming is not so hard, but knowing what to build can  make or break of a project. Your developer should do everything to lead you to success. A failed project is the consequence of a failed developer. A good foundation will result in a successful website.</p>

<p>When it comes to making websites, you can bill by the hour or by the project. You can pay X00$/hr to a well skilled developer. You can also pay a X,000,000 - X00,000 figure to develop a full scale website for your company. In either case, your focus is to get the most bang for your buck. You are looking to pay someone to lead you to success.</p>

<p>Your developers goal should not be justifying how much they are being paid. Your developers responsibility is making sure your digital presence successfully and effectively solves your problem. A web developer is a creator of solutions</p>

<p>Regardless of how you decide to pay, you need to understand there are different ways of developing. The traditional methods from the past decade is based on the &#8220;waterfall&#8221; method. The &#8220;waterfall&#8221; method depends on designing a website specification, signing a bloated contract, then pushing the contract through its individual &#8220;steps&#8221;.</p>

<p>Traditionally, your web developer will &#8220;design&#8221; the mockups of the website in an image editor like Photoshop. They will provide you a few examples of what individual pages may look like, and be sure to charge you for each mockup. Next, they will &#8220;code&#8221; the mockup into their preferred web framework (hopefully they are at least using a CMS) and then present you with what was intended to be <em>the design</em>.</p>

<p>100% of the time (yes, 100%), at least one side is surprised by the outcomes. The coded version of the site resembles the original design, but reveals the many points where discussion was lacking and incomplete. Additionally, when the coded mockup is viewed across devices and browsers, it completely loses it&#8217;s structure and fails.</p>

<p>Wait, theres more! Your &#8220;waterfall&#8221; developer recommends this methods because they believe it will expedite the website development process. They also make it known that you are limited in the number of changes you are allowed to make. Or they make sure you know the cost of making changes.</p>

<p>So wait, your wondering if theres an alternative. You believe, &#8220;this is how developing websites works. Its painful, costly, and both side leave having to make sacrifices&#8221;. In fact, that sounds more like poor congressional politics than web development.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not the only way. (To be continued)</p>

    <link href="http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2012/12/16/zurb-foundation/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-16T11:59:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://lkbgift.github.com/blog/2012/12/16/zurb-foundation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TLDR: The SASS Zurb Foundation install makes it easy to make a fully customized responsive website.</strong></p>

<p>Making a new website can be extremely easy or very time consuming. Tools available through Open-source projects, Creative Commons, and GNU licenses make it easy to layout a prototype in no time.</p>

<p>Some of the obvious ones are <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> (+20,000 stars on Github) and <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. My personal recent favorite is <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> from <a href="http://zurb.com/">Zurb</a>. I took a liking to Foundation because it gave me an edge at mocking up marketing pages without having to go through an extensive design and copywriting process.</p>

<p>Zurb&#8217;s Foundation uses <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> to make getting started and customizing very easy. You don&#8217;t have to track down CSS elements or worse, overwrite existing declarations. Foundation provides clear documentation regarding what is provided and how it can be used.</p>

<p>When paired with Compass, Foundation compiles a series of &#8220;Foundational&#8221; SASS stylesheets into a clearly documented CSS file. The SASS files make use of the <a href="http://thecodingdesigner.com/tutorials/variables-css-sass">variable notation</a>, allowing new users to change the existing styles, rather than overwriting. This can be particularly useful when you are trying to keep your CSS clean and well documented.</p>

<p>To make changes, Foundation provides a file called <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.php">_settings.sass</a>. This file has all of the variables available for customization. All variables are presented commented out, so to make changes, just uncomment and change. Rather than overwriting the existing selectors, this keeps the CSS selectors light and easy to manage (<a href="http://smacss.com/">Snooks</a> would approve).</p>

<p>Foundation makes a webpage look really great from the beginning (like Twitter Bootstrap). Some of us don&#8217;t like the default Helvetica Neue and recognizable colors.  Differentiating your installation of Foundation is easy. The <a href="http://zurb.com/">problem</a> with Twitter Bootstrap is that most websites using it don&#8217;t do enough altercations to make it look different.</p>

<p>The two major changes that make your website look different are changing the default colors and the fonts. Again, using the SASS <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/sass.php">_settings</a> file, you only make changes to the $mainColor, $bodyFontFamily, and $headerFontFamily. Once these changes are made, you have a extremely unique, responsive, well functioning website.</p>

<p>One letdown of Foundation is the dependence on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html">box-model</a>. (Let it be know, I <a href="http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/">love box-model</a> too. Still, it doesn&#8217;t work with old browsers.) Box-model as a CSS property which calculates the padding inside the width. This simplifies calculating percentages for fluid layouts, but sadly this property is not available in IE6.</p>

<p>Fortunately the dependance on box-model can be circumvented with <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/mobile-boilerplate/wiki/Media-Queries-Polyfill">polyfills</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation/issues/684">explicitly defined layouts</a>. Still, Foundation&#8217;s development without consideration for older browsers makes it difficult to use for my current demographic.</p>

<p>Overall, Foundation makes it easy to build websites. Paired with <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">Codekit</a> (which deserves a post of its own) or <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, starting and managing new sites enjoyable!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TLDR: Stick some aluminum wads between the mouse and the battery&#8217;s (+) connector.</strong></p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s Magic Mouse is a great tool for Mac owners. The engineering behind the <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2009/11/new-magic-mouse-secrets-revealed-in-apple-patent.html">multitouch technology</a> is undeniably advanced. Its responsive, sleak, and easy to carry around. The multitouch functionality allows you to flip through pages on your OSX screen and access your dashboard with ease. The touch scrolling technology creates a whole new way to browse webpages.</p>

<p>Recently, my Magic Mouse has been disconnecting frequently. I was unsure of the problem source and assumed it was related to frequently carrying the mouse in my bag. Although there was no visible damage to the mouse itself, the frequent disconnection made it nearly impossible to use.</p>

<p>Google search for &#8220;Magic Mouse Disconnect&#8221; and you find similar grievances on <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2217770?start=90&amp;tstart=0" title="Apple's Discussion Board">Apple&#8217;s own forums</a>. One product owner went as far as replacing a fleet of Magic Mouses for his iMacs. A seemingly costly investment. Others reverted from the wireless conveneince to the alternate wired mice.</p>

<p>Sadly, the extensive replacements were done in vain. The source of the problem is not damage related, but rather a poor design on Apples part. The Magic Mouse&#8217;s battery compartment expends the (+) end of batteries to stick out a lot. This is a problem when you are using poorly made discount batteries.</p>

<p>The solution is to stuff a wad of aluminum foil between the batteries and the mouse&#8217;s (+) connectors. This seems like a solution that could have been easily solved with better engineering. I just feel bad for the guy who disposed of all the perfectly functional Magic Mice.</p>
