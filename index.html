  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Internet for lead generation</h1>

<p>There&#8217;s a number of ways you can increase business through the Internet. One effective approach is to target certain websites or services as platforms for advertising. Another method is to compete for search engine keywords by generating keyword rich content on your website. Lastly, you post your company on the variety of directory websites that display professional services. Each option has it&#8217;s own benefits and can/should be used in tandem with one another.</p>

<p>Each method has its&#8217; own cost/benefit and area of efficacy. Depending on your strategy, you will invest time or money. In areas that cost money, you will look for the lowest cost for acquiring a customer. Of you spend time, you will want to maximize the benefit of what you do.</p>

<h1>Online advertising</h1>

<p>For advertising, you typically pay for a number of impressions. The goal of any advertising campaign is to find a high number of relevant viewers. In the case of online advertising, relevancy means geographic location and customer need. Your advertising provider will sell you inventory based on keywords on pages. For example, google will sell you advertisements on google products when your selected advertisement display criteria are displayed on a page.</p>

<p>Of course, because there is limited inventory for advertisements, the higher demand advertisements cost higher. High demand keywords are more expensive than unusual keywords. Think of it as displaying a billboard on a busy street, verses a rural driveway.</p>

<p>The Internet is different in that high demand keywords are not always most favorable for you. You may think &#8220;Los Angeles psychiatry&#8221; is the best keyword for you. It contains both geographic and topic relevance. The obvious match makes it a high demand keyword set and consequently expensive target.</p>

<h2>Selecting keywords</h2>

<p>For cost-effective advertising, you need to think like your customer. If advertising on a search engine, rather than selecting the obvious keyword match, target something your customer would type. This can be a question, sentence or fragmented thought. By targeted more words, your ad will come up less and consequently cost less. Similarly, your audience will be specific enough that they are typing exactly what you are targeting. Some example targets may be &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling depressed about (enter a topic)&#8221;, &#8220;who do I talk to about my middle school (choose a incident)&#8221;, or &#8220;sad related personal support&#8221;. The goal is to indirectly target your audience through insight that you can infer.</p>

<p>You must be wondering where to purchase these advertisements or where the advertisement lead. In general, google&#8217;s Adwords program is a safe place to experiment. Just google Adwords and it will link you to the process. Adwords let you target audiences through setting keywords and determining what regional areas will display your advertisements. The regions are targeted by IP addresses and are generally correct.</p>

<h2>Targeting online destinations</h2>

<p>Another route is to look at specific websites you believe your target demographic uses. This could be a forum, web application, log, or news source. Platforms like these will have a specific area on their site to advertise. From there, you often pay to have your banner or link displayed for a set period of time. Again, like the keywords, it&#8217;s best to target places that are indirectly related to your audience. The advertisements you purchase will run for a week/month/etc. the advertisement host should have some details regarding the potential audience&#8217;s demographic.</p>

<p>Back to the other part of the question, where do these advertisements lead to? Rather than squeezing all your contact information and a catch phrase into a small space, you will display advertisements with some &#8220;hook&#8221; and a link to a webpage you set. Often this page should be a landing page in your website. This lets you display a specific message to the advertisement leadvertisements, as well as offer access to other resources that may convince them to contact you.</p>

<h3>Landing pages</h3>

<p>Landing pages are very typical. They contain: a short sentence selling the customer, a short contact form, a few details about your services, a set of testimonials, and another contact form. These pages have been heavily tested for efficacy, so there&#8217;s no need for creating a new method.</p>

<h3>Analytics</h3>

<p>When running any campaign, it&#8217;s also good practice to measure the traffic on your site. This is the field of web analytics. There are numerous free products that allow you to gain rich insight into your
your websites visitors.</p>

<h1>Search engine optimization</h1>

<p>In addition to advertising, you can focus on generating search engine traffic. This is a natural process that can generate massive traffic. The method is similar to keyword targeted advertisements. The difference is that you generate content on your website that will trigger search engines to display your website for targeted keywords.</p>

<h2>Content generation</h2>

<p>Specifically, this requires you to be doing some kind of writing that is posted on your website. The writing can be in the form of blog posts that review topics your audience may be searching about. The key is to write in a way that makes search engines easily associate your content to your desired keyword. To do this, you focus on writing semantic articles that have marked up headings with you keywords. In addition, the article piece Gould naturally repeat the target keyword multiple time. This may seem like an impediment to the wrong process, but it is relatively normal on most Internet writing.</p>

<h2>Rich data attributes</h2>

<p>In addition to generating content, you can configure your existing site to leverage any rich attributes that search engines may look for in a webpage. Rich attributes are marked up pieces of information that may be displayed in a search result. Examples are author names, addresses, business hours, site maps, and other information. Some search engines, also reward users for being loyal to their services. For instance, displaying a Google+ account on your website&#8217;s pages will increase your search ranking.</p>

<p>The goal for optimizing search engine visibility is to help make a robot understand the content of your webpage. The search engines goal is to display the most appropriate search results for any keywords. One major part is the existence of relevant content. The next important part is inbound links from other websites. In particular, the links need to come from resources that are associated to your websites topic. By having inbound links from relevant sources, search engines can effectively perceive your website&#8217;s topic.</p>

<h1>Listing in professional directories</h1>

<p>Lastly, you can also list yourself on a variety of professional services directory websites. This includes, but is no where limited to, websites like Yelp.com, YellowPages, Craigslist or whatever other sites come up when you do general searches for professionals in your field. The key on these sites are to have your existing customers write positive feedback. The Internet is designed to reward people with higher ratings, rarer than give fresh people an opportunity for exposure. In other words, there are many people on directory websites or service listing websites that get very little attention. Rather a small group of people get a majority of the traffic through the juxtaposition of being positively rated. Having 3-6 ratings can make all the difference.</p>

<p>The sites that are most effective for you to list will often require you to register and submit company descriptions. To expedite your registration process, identify what is commonly required (business name, description, services offered, hours of operation, location, etc) and have them in a document to copy and paste. This will let you expedite the registration process. Keep in mind, many of these I recorded are under operation from very few individuals, so you will need to resolve issues yourself.</p>

<p>There are endless more means for utilizing modern media to drive business traffic. The three points I mentioned are the most general. I hope that helps and let me know if you have any more questions!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>On meeting strangers</h1>

<p>You should be meeting more strangers. Strangers are scary, smelly, often have lopsided feet, and more than anything, have a lot to offer you. Whether you are sitting on a bus, picking up your mail, getting a cup of coffee, or sitting in your house watching TV while secretly watching what you neighbors do, the strangers in your life have a lot to offer you.])</p>

<h2>Talk to everyone and anyone.</h2>

<p>I mean everyone. You would be very surprised how much the people you casually talk to can offer you exactly what you need. Once you talk to your first stranger, you will be on your way to learning more about the world. Through talking to strangers, you can learn about different careers, life struggles, current events, and occasionally a new cookie recipe. When your standing in line for groceries, getting a cup of your favorite drink, or sitting alone quietly. You can simply start a conversation with &#8220;hello, my name is _____&#8221; (please don&#8217;t actually say &#8216;underscore-underscore-underscore-underscore&#8221;. Fill in your name instead). Another effective method is joining conversations that have nothing to do with you. While you feel like this is totally unacceptable and disrespectful (it mostly is), occasionally its a great way to get past all the awkward conversation and get straight to the point (&#8220;I love chocolate chip bacon covered whiskey dipped cookies too!&#8221;) From there you can take the conversation anywhere.</p>

<h2>Break all the ice.</h2>

<p>Global warm that shit. Start by being as intrusive as possible, so as to learn about the persons personal life. The sooner you can break the ice, the sooner you can have a new friend. Don&#8217;t worry that you don&#8217;t know anything about this person. Did you hear a word that sounds vaguely interesting? Does the person have really well hemmed pants? Maybe you want to know whats in the bag they are carrying (&#8220;So whats in the bag?&#8221;). Take them off guard with a question they wouldn&#8217;t expect from a stranger. Find a commonality and make some personal association to its relationship to you. (&#8220;Nice novel on ax murdering. I love ax murdering…&#8221;).</p>

<h2>Make it easy to get in touch.</h2>

<p>Get a business card. Have a portfolio website to show off. Make your twitter handle easy to pronounce. Stop using that email address you made in 2001 and make something that doesn&#8217;t have the . By talking to strangers and asking them what they do, you will naturally start up a conversation. (Unless you just creep the person out and need to run away out of fear. If you run away, don&#8217;t worry. They can&#8217;t judge you because they are still trying to figure out what just happened.)</p>

<p>But seriously. Go talk to a stranger. Go make friends with someone on the street. Jump in a taxi with someone, even if you&#8217;re not trying to go anywhere. And start making friends.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have developed a four step process to help me learn from coding blogs. There seems to be an endless number of programmers who enjoy sharing their software development discoveries in blog posts and articles. I often find these very informative, although not always well written. Sometimes there is (what seems like) a missing part or gap. I find that the core concepts are discussed, but the directions seem to miss explaining how to get &#8220;there&#8221;.</p>

<p>Although instructions are not present, I find that code examples are numerous. Specifically, code examples without explanation behind their inner-workings or core-concepts. As a result, I started pragmatically reviewing the code myself. I use the code examples that are completely foreign to me, to begin a process of exploration and discovery. I have documented this process with examples for readers.</p>

<h1>Step -1: Always be coding</h1>

<p>I find the best way to solve a problem is by having a contextual and relevant application. Without the relevance, you won&#8217;t be able to remember the problem. You might forget the idea, but you won&#8217;t be able to apply what you learned when the same problem appears out of context. I find the problems I understand best are the ones I learn to solve when encountered during actual development. This is one of the reasons side-projects are crucial. <strong>Always be coding</strong> and you will always be learning.</p>

<h1>Step 0: Identify well written articles and dependable educational resources</h1>

<p>There are literally hundreds of email newsletters that compile the &#8220;best&#8221; articles of development in your field. I get no less than 10 a week. Some of languages I feel overly confident about and others that I am only just starting to learn. Regular exposure to newsletters, as well as online coding communities (such as <a href="http://reddit.com/r/webdev" title="Reddits webdev community">Reddit/r/webdev</a> or HackerNews) will keep you exposed to the well written articles and best educational resources available.</p>

<p>My personal favorite for front-end questions is the Mozilla Development Network (MDN). The MDN has the best documentation on all web related APIs. This means anything you want to learn about HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and web APIs are well documented here. To discover these resources, you can use Google. Simply add the string &#8220;MDN&#8221; to a search query and you will find the relevant resources</p>

<p>Using Twitter and Github to follow well known developers has been priceless. Whenever I find an article I enjoy, I follow the authors twitter account (This is a great time for me to say &#8221;<a href="http://twitter.com/lkbcc" title="Twitter link to @Lkbcc">Follow me on Twitter @Lkbcc</a>&#8221;). By following developers, you can see what links are being shared and most importantly who they follow. The twitter feeds of developers, open source projects and companies are often the best place for discovery.</p>

<h1>Step 1: Place your browser beside a note taking application</h1>

<p><img src="http://lkb.cc/images/20130601-1-notes-and-browser.jpg" title="Taking notes on an article using Notational Velocity" alt="Screenshot of Chrome web browser beside Notational Velocity note taking application" /></p>

<p>Open up a code editor or note taking application and open it side-by-side your browser window. You are going to write down every idea/snippet/word that you don&#8217;t understand. This is crucial. Being aware of what you don&#8217;t know will allow you to advance. It may be painful to realize you read a paragraph, only to write down nearly every word in your notes, but this is where you can start moving forward.</p>

<p>You picked an article with an interesting but difficult topic and lines-on-lines of coding examples. You are about to learn some thing new. Be confident that you can learn this idea, even if it seems completely out of reach. Most of programming is not about being smart, but pushing through the foreign ideas until it &#8220;clicks&#8221;. Just as Woody Alan says, &#8220;Showing up is half the battle&#8221;. Seriously, just read through the stuff you don&#8217;t understand, and the exposure to the foreign ideas will be hugely beneficial.</p>

<p>For note taking, I use a program called Notational Velocity. Its a very simple application that makes all my notes easily searchable. I&#8217;ve seen people effectively use Evernote, TextEdit, and even Word Processors. I find the most important thing is reducing the friction to start the note taking process. I like Notational Velocity because it natively binds a keyboard shortcut to pull up/hide the editor. This process can actually be assigned to any application through a computer&#8217;s System Preferences.</p>

<h1>Step 2: Copy down code examples. Write them out again from memory</h1>

<p>When you read articles, if you <em>just</em> read the articles, they won&#8217;t do sit nicely in your head. Like a poorly written Backbone application, you&#8217;ll have a memory leak, until all the time you took to learn will be forgotten. The best way to remember is to physically go through the code and write it down. If I learned anything from Zed Shaw in his Learning Python the Hard Way, it was the value of copying code.</p>

<p>Often, you will get into the flow of copying/writing out code, without being conscious. Other times, you will be conscious of how impossibly terse a code block is and will not understand it. This is okay. At times, I physically write out code blocks with pen and paper, because it forces me to slow down. Regardless of how you do it, the next part is very important.</p>

<p><img src="http://lkb.cc/images/20130601-2-browser-and-code.jpg" title="Writing out code blocks in Sublime Text 3" alt="Writing out code blocks in Sublime Text 3" /></p>

<p>Write out the previously copied code purely from memory. You can do it write underneath the copied code or in a new page or document. The exercise will force you to be present. No copying aloud. You should go back as needed and look at the original code to jump your memory, but the purpose of this important step is honestly reflecting on what you don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>The hardest part of learning to code for me is stubbornness. I either like to default to assuming something is too hard to understand or make believe that I don&#8217;t need to know an idea. I almost always find myself encountering the same problem or code concepts without fully committing time to understanding them. Don&#8217;t do this. But sometimes you can write something from memory and still not understand it.</p>

<h1>Step 3: Write out directions to write the previous code</h1>

<p><img src="http://lkb.cc/images/20130601-3-code-instructions.jpg" title="Second iteration of describing the original code example" alt="Second iteration of describing the original code example" /></p>

<p>Next, write out english sentences that tell you exactly what each line of code does. You need to be clear enough that reading these sentences will allow you to understand how to recreate the original lines of code. Do this without giving yourself specific coding syntax. If possible, use the vocabulary to properly describe the code. If you don&#8217;t know the vocabulary, then its good to check out places like the MDN to review.</p>

<p>This may be weird because you just effectively &#8220;memorized&#8221; the previous snippet. A proven effective method of learning is to teach what you know. In the context of coding, you can teach yourself. By treating yourself as both the teacher and student, you can deepen your ability to communicate the coding concepts. Your success in this step will be seen when able to use the instructions to recreate the exact same code as the original code block.</p>

<h1>Step 4: Recreate the original code using your instructions</h1>

<p>Using your instructions, attempt to write out the original block of code. Be strict with yourself and follow your instructions. Don&#8217;t pull from your memory (Assume an irreversible memory leak). Go through your instructions, and line-by-line try to write what you communicated to yourself.</p>

<pre><code>// Example for completed description
// define function called getHTTPObject
// check if XMLHttpRequest exists
// if it does return it as a constructor
// otherwise try to return the constructor for ActiveXObject with Msxml2.XMLHTTP attribute
// check for errors
// and if they come up try to return a constructor for ActiveXObject with Microsoft.XMLHTTP attribute
// check for errors again and kill the process
// After the original conditional, return false

function getHTTPObject(){
  if (typeof XMLHttpRequest != "undefined"){
    return new XMLHttpRequest;
  } 
  try {
    return new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP")
  } catch (e) {
    try {
      return new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
    } catch (e) {}
  }
  return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do anything like me, then your initial instructions are going to suck. Through this forced consciousness process, you will notice parts that you either missed or didn&#8217;t understand enough to explain. Review the actual code and try to revisit your instructions again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important that during this process, you are not looking at the code while writing the instructions. As much as possible, try to understand the idea, move away from the original, then document your understanding. This is maximize your opportunity to discover where you don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<h1>Step 5: There is no step 5</h1>

<p><img src="http://lkb.cc/images/20130601-4-code-success.jpg" title="Code cat success" alt="Code cat success" /></p>

<p>You have iterated this process enough to accomplish your end goal of writing instructions that clearly explain the code, you will have accomplished one of two things: mindlessly memorized completely useless code, or remembered the syntax/framework/structure of some code which you don&#8217;t completely understand.</p>

<p>If you are in the latter, then you&#8217;re on the right path. You realize that no code is perfect and often your understanding of concepts too is imperfect. More importantly, you realize how to communicate what you know and also provide yourself a mechanism for understand what other people are trying to communicate. You provide yourself a strong tool for learning from the plethora of undocumented, but very useful code.</p>

<p>Hopefully this idea was not new to you and you have now learned an effective way to push yourself to learn new coding concepts. Take notes, copy down code examples, give yourself instructions to rewrite the examples, and most importantly look up all the questions you have!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Why learn?</h1>

<p>I have spent the past three years developing websites. I have been hired by clients ranging from startups to fortune 500 corporations. Yet, I don&#8217;t have any formal training as a computer scientist or digital designer. I went to school to study in a Liberal Arts program in the humanities. I read books on cultural theory, history, and adopted an obscure love for classical literature (Goethe I&#8217;m looking at you).</p>

<p>So why does this all matter? Well, like most people, I wanted to get on the band wagon of utilizing the immense power available today in the form of technology. I saw computers as the beginning, but instantly knew before smart phones that mobile technologies were offering amazing opportunities through widely distributed data networks. I wanted to use this, but I didn&#8217;t have any training. I think a lot of people around my age (and those who are not) have this feeling.</p>

<p>I started learning web development, and more recently Javascript. Javascript was my &#8220;in&#8221; to the growing digital frontier. Making a website was foreign to me, but I found people would pay me to do it, so I invested my time to get good at it. I identified the front-end (User Experience, User facing elements, Design) web development as most interesting to me.</p>

<h1>Deciding the front-end</h1>

<p>Deciding I would become prolific at front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/Javascript), I found myself struggling with the abstract concepts of Javascript. I also noticed that Javascript could potentially offer the most learning value. As the founder of Javascript says, &#8220;Always bet on Javascript&#8221;.</p>

<p>I traverse the infinitum of blog posts being written on software engineering to find the rare nuggets of informative learning resources. I find myself attracted by titles to blog posts, but unable to comprehend the complex code blocks. Instead, I browse the (often Jekyll or Octopress) blog posts, only to read the commentary and skip of the code segments.</p>

<p>My greatest obstacle when reading code is that I&#8217;m feeling like I understand the code, but fail to absorb the lessons. Overcoming the mammoth that is learning to code by adopting good practices has significantly helped. I can confidently say, I am not good at learning over the internet or even teaching myself how to do &#8220;stuff&#8221;. Instead, I am good at identifying my faults in remembering and make up for it by creating processes that make me &#8220;fail forward&#8221;.</p>

<p>I know that I fail at absorbing coding concepts. I also know that I am good at learning from mistakes. I combine the two understandings about myself by forming a practice to force myself to fail at absorbing coding concepts by making guided mistakes. I do this without another teacher guiding me or a tutor.</p>

<p>Note: The term &#8220;Failing into the pit of success&#8221; was a term developed by a software developer at Microsoft.</p>

<p>Freelancers miss sales opportunities due to time traveling and poor coordination. Once we have production on the first DeLorean is complete, this will no longer be an issue. Until then, talent with GPS devices can broadcast their travel itinerary to acquire clients on the go.</p>

<h1>Fab.com CEO Jason Goldberg</h1>

<p>Jason Goldberg came to NYU&#8217;s Startup week this week to speak with <a href="http://penenberg.com/">Adam Penenberg</a>. Penenberg led Goldberg through his entrepreneurial path from college dropout to CEO. Goldberg&#8217;s success and ongoing journey encourages eager adventurers like myself. A few points from Goldberg:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s worth pursuing what you believe is meaningful, even if it means dropping out of school (twice).</li>
<li>Find the one thing you are particularly good at and focus on it.</li>
<li>Find a partner who you admire.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t outsource. Make partnerships.</li>
<li>Invest in customers, rather than short-term revenue.</li>
</ol>


<h2>It&#8217;s worth pursuing what you believe is meaningful, even if it means dropping out of school (twice).</h2>

<p>Goldberg was born in Rockville, Maryland (followed by a single cheer in the audience) and went Emeryville for his bachelors degree. He dropped out of college in 91&#8217; to work on Bill Clintons presidential campaign. Believed in Clinton before he was the Democratic nominee, but saw the potential behind Clinton&#8217;s cause. His first volunteer position was to &#8220;drive around the wife&#8221; when she came to visit Atlanta. Ended up spending six and a half years in the Whitehouse in the economic council with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_Bowles#The_Clinton_years">Erskine Bowles</a>. By 1998, he was a completely different person (joking about weighing 185 pounds) and worked 7 days a week.</p>

<p>To take a break, he decided to go to business school at Stanford. While at Stanford, received a call from Bowles under the lines of (cue southern drawl) &#8220;I just put 50 million dollars in a company, but don&#8217;t know what they do. Can you find out for me?&#8221;. Left Stanford mid-degree to join the startup Bowles invested into and began the startup culture of the dot-com era. This is where he saw excess and understood the importance of a business model. He also learned this is where you invest in people that you know.</p>

<p>Following the dot com bubble&#8217;s burst, he moved to AOL Time Warner, right after the merger. He did strategy work but knew he was more interested in operations and management. He also knew that he was much more focused on user experience and moved to T-Mobile, where he worked on their first hotspot network. This was his first &#8220;big win&#8221; in his career. After finishing his project, the T-mobile CEO said &#8220;you can do whatever you want&#8221;. Shortly after, Goldberg pursued his own company.</p>

<h2>Find the one thing you are particularly good at and focus on it.</h2>

<p>For Goldberg, he knew his talent was in User Experience. Rather than being stuck micromanaging every part of his own company, he wanted to focus on the part that he knew best. His past projects were always recognized comparatively as the best user experiences. Rather than being caught up in all parts of the business, he wanted to lead the thing he knew best: User Experience. This is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>Goldberg&#8217;s first company in 2003 was a job-centered social network called Jobster. He noticed that the best hires at his companies were the friends of existing effective employees. Jobster was mean to help hiring &#8220;someone who knew someone who knew someone else&#8221;. The idea that good people knew good people that you should hire, resulted in a social network before its time. LinkedIn, coming a year later, approached the same space through creating a network. Jobster approached it by creating the tools that a company could use to tap a network.</p>

<p>Jobster had good ideas, but Goldberg felt he &#8220;ran too fast&#8221;. Instead of focusing on the one thing that he knew he was good at, he was involved in everything else. By doing everything, he got nothing done. Through the process he learned if he started another company, he would focus on being the project manager. Sadly, his next project was with Microsoft developers on a Microsoft development cycle. The one-year development cycle didn&#8217;t work for the internet.</p>

<p>When Facebook launched, he saw how apps were launching with millions of downloads going viral. Discovering an app making use of the emerging social-graph, he contacted the developers asking to &#8220;buy your company&#8221;. He discovered the app was built by two engineers in India and couldn&#8217;t even keep their servers running because of the traffic they received. As a result, he hired them to work at Jobster and built a product in four weeks that was better than anything the company had built before.</p>

<p>His new product enabled a very simple aggregate of the people in your social network circle. Goldberg related it to Facebook&#8217;s News Feed, before it existed. The focus was helping people discover news, just the way he was interested in discovering the news. The product was rolling out right before the election cycle and in under a year had several million users. The company sold in fourth quarter to a European social network, Zing.</p>

<h2>Find a partner who you admire.</h2>

<p>Goldberg moved to work in Germany to work on Zing, where he missed his boyfriend. This led him to decide on building a social network for gay men. The idea was developed with Bradford Shellhammer, who Goldberg had met years before outside a nightclub at 2am. Goldberg stayed friends with Shellhammer through mutual respect for one another. He felt Shellhammer was one of the most creative people he has ever met. &#8220;Bradford brought color to peoples lives.&#8221; To add, Shellhammer was showcased in Times magazine, twice.</p>

<p>The first idea of Fabulous was well timed with the trend for a new gay culture. Goldberg was confident in building a new product. Fabulous was &#8220;Gay foursquare meets gay trip advisor meets gay deal of the day&#8221;. Goldberg saw his relationships with Shellhammer as &#8220;Im a geek and your a gay&#8221; so we should do something. He knew he could build an amazing user experience and he had complete faith in the style that Shellhammer would produce.</p>

<p>In 2010, the two decided they would leverage their community to start selling stuff. On paper the idea for Fabulous looked perfect, but it wasn&#8217;t taking off. The mainstreaming of gay culture made a gay app less needed. Glee, Modern Family, Grindr and all these &#8220;things&#8221; started coming up. Goldberg states, &#8220;even Facebook turned gay&#8221;. Seeing that the only successful communities were being based around sex, he wan&#8217;t to shift into selling stuff.</p>

<p>The idea for Fab took off during a dinner with Shellhammer. After three bottles of wine at the Market Village, they decided they were not leaving until they figured out what they were doing next. They liked working together, recognized the unique talents they brought together, and both wanted to work on &#8220;design&#8221;. Using Shellhammer&#8217;s taste, Goldberg suggested &#8220;lets build a business around your tastes and sensibilities to the world&#8221;.</p>

<p>Shortly after the decision, they told their Board of Directors a plan to shutdown the existing website and move ahead with their new idea. Note, they had no idea what they were going to do and were clear with their investors that they could step out and get their money back if they wanted.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Being in China</h2>

<p>The ex-patriots in China are very aware of the internet restrictions. Aka, internet with Chinese characteristics. It’s hard to explain to others what it’s like behind the Great Firewall. No facebook, no NY Times, and the sense of consistency. Beyond the occasional officially-unofficial media blackouts, most of the world doesn&#8217;t think about what the internet is like in China, even though there are more internet users in China than there are citizens of the United States. <a href="http://j.mp/12wZ7mL">apira.org</a></p>

<p>The censorship is secondary to considerations of the internet for web developers targeting Chinese users. In China, Internet Explorer 6 was king for far too long. The fallout from its history is obvious for web developers from the West. Like myself, China facing websites do not have the luxury of ignoring &#8220;obsolete&#8221; users. In a country where there are over 250 million Internet Explorer users, China facing websites consider an incredibly aggressive browser ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Battle against the obsolete</h2>

<p>There have, however, been enormous improvements in browser technologies recently. Two years ago IE6 had a 60% market share in China (<a href="http://j.mp/13HOpZG">w3.org</a>. Today, the wonderful website <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">IE6CountDown</a> states IE6 is a little more than 25% of the Chinese internet user population.</p>

<p>The problem with IE6 is not one of ignorance. IE6’s prior domination of the Chinese browser-share was the result of China’s piracy ecosystem. Remember the Windows XP system updates? If you remember correctly, only authorized editions of Windows XP are allowed to make those system updates. Because Chinese street markets sell a lot of &#8220;low-cost&#8221; software (aka, pirated software), a lot of Chinese computers can’t get official system updates. Old computers without system updates are unable to upgrade from their original IE6 browser.</p>

<p>Adding insult to injury, Chinese web developers target the IE6 browsers. Jerry Jinks from <a href="http://www.maxthon.com/about-us/">Maxthon</a> (a Chinese web browser provider) elegantly <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2012/06/interview_huawei_maxthon_qihoo.html">explained</a> the IE6 problem: &#8220;There&#8217;s a vicious cycle around IE6 in China: users keep using it because sites are designed for IE6, and people build sites for IE6 because users stay with it.&#8221; By having a market that depends on IE6, web developers can continue buildings for obsolete systems. Table based layouts, Dreamweaver WYSIWYG markup, and browser hacks litter Chinese websites.</p>

<p>Although the problem is large, the problem has not gone unaddressed. Microsoft partnered with Chinese anti-virus and internet browser company Qihoo 360 to systematically eliminate IE6. The partnership allowed Qihoo to make upgrades to the default browser on Windows XP systems from IE6 to IE8. Because Qihoo markets itself as a “security solution,” users recognize the need to download and install the new software. While users feel they are more secure, Qihoo is really just another web browser.</p>

<p>Qihoo’s browser is based on a Microsoft browser framework called Trident. Trident, like Webkit, is a rendering engine which allows browser makers to have a solid starting point. Rather than rewriting a complete browser engine, browser developers can start from solid footing to customize the user experience, rather than the rendering engine. For reasons related to China’s interest in Microsoft products, Trident has been very popular.</p>

<p>Two of the largest China based browsers, Qihoo and Maxthon, use Trident (<a href="http://j.mp/15A73RR">sec.gov</a>). Trident was developed by Microsoft to server as a web rendering engine for applications accessing web pages. Trident leverages parts of Internet Explorer, Webkit, and Chrome for various tasks. Interestingly enough, although Trident continues to develop today, the versions in Qihoo and Maxthon are dependent on IE8. Although the Chinese markets are moving off IE6, they are still using IE8. For web developers, that means no media-queries, no CSS3&#8230;</p>

<p>For browser developers, using an existing rendering engines makes sense. The W3C and WHATWG have both been emphasizing the need for browser consistency. After the intensional varriance of Netscape and Internet Explorer in the 90’s, browsers started keeping to a set of rules. For new browsers developing, like Qihoo and Maxthon, using existing rendering engines allows the companies to focus on other features. For example, Qihoo focuses on firewall and virus scanning tools. Compared to other alternative browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, marketing based on the value of security has worked in Qihoo’s favor.</p>

<h2>Different priorities</h2>

<p>China&#8217;s web infrastructure growth has impressed me with its high internet penetration rates, but the websites themselves are not so innovative. To be fair to Chinese web developers, though, there is a different focus on developing for the web in China. Users here don&#8217;t want the newest technologies just because they are available. Again, as <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2012/06/interview_huawei_maxthon_qihoo.html">Jerry Jinks stated</a>, &#8220;They just want to see the Web&#8221;. The issue is along the expectations behind the Chinese internet consumers. Just because there are a lot of users, does not by any means result in high quality websites.</p>

<p>US web users are spoiled. If a website isn’t pretty or doesn&#8217;t load in a set period of time, they don’t want to visit the site. There is research that proves this (<a href="http://j.mp/Yf5WRn">seomoz</a>. Chinese users browsing habits are still developing. Standing on a train and looking over people&#8217;s shoulders, you see people reading websites rendered without any CSS.</p>

<p>Importance is not widely placed on web standards. Beautiful, shiny, CSS3-filled, progressively enhanced HTML5 websites are few in China. In fact, there are some web practices that are simply painful to watch (<a href="http://zombo.com/">queue Flash splash page leading to table layout website</a>). The need for old browser coverage results in the sheer inability to embrace innovative technologies. It doesn&#8217;t help that new libraries and frameworks are proudly dropping support for IE6 and IE7.
Ironically, in a place where old browsers are such a problem, I have yet to see a Chinese progressively enhance or gracefully degrading website. When Modernizer and polyfills are being developed for the exact purpose of serving the worlds edge case browsers, I don&#8217;t see a wide range of Chinese adopters.</p>

<p>There’s a plethora of digital and printed content about web development available in English, but rarely to I see the same kind of material circulated in China. While I don&#8217;t know if an internet growth market would be interested in the concepts of web standards, it could benefit from access to the discussions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There is something to be said for the recent popularization of dropping support for old browsers. Undeniably, costs to develop for old browsers can be unreasonably high and unmanageable. Still, it should be considered that dropping support for old browsers entails dropping support for huge parts of the world. I am certain that in the coming years, China won&#8217;t be as affected by this issue. Mobile browsers are exponentially claiming internet browser marketshare. For mobile devices alone, heads are turning toward standards and HTML5.</p>

<p>Until then, don&#8217;t forget about the products Made in China and good luck finding stylish Chinese system fonts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="https://forrst-live.s3.amazonaws.com/multiposts/images/39039/mega.png?1363124354" alt="Using TileMill" /></p>

<h1>TileMill makes beautiful maps</h1>

<p><a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> is a downloadable program that allows you to make beautiful maps. The software is developed by <a href="http://mapbox.com/">MapBox</a>, a company that provides OpenSource maps as a service.</p>

<p>TileMill is a basic GUI for skinning GIS data. Using a CSS like language, called <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">CartoCSS</a>, users can modify and add visual elements. CartoCSS provides conditional logic, allowing styles to target specific segments of data.</p>

<p>An example of segmented data styling is in open data regarding city populations. Using the CartoCSS, you can render a circle on all of the cities in the world. Using conditional logic, you can make the circle bigger or smaller based on the population of the city.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>To get an introduction to TileMill, I suggest going through the <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/">Crash Course</a> provided by MapBox. The crash course will show you how to load in external data sets, provide conditional styling, and export your map (or upload it online).</p>

<h2>Quick Lesson</h2>

<p>I <a href="http://forrst.com/posts/Beautiful_maps_with_CSS_and_open_data-FRM">showcased a map</a> I made for Acquinity Interactive on <a href="http://forrst.com">Forrst</a> this week. On it, I showed the working files of the TileMill map I created. One of the users requested that I explain how to make something like this.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Download and install</h3>

<p>I won&#8217;t go into detail. Get the program <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">here</a> and install it.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Start a new project</h3>

<p>Click Projects > New project. Set a filename. Make sure the &#8220;Default data&#8221; box is check. Then click Add. Click the newly created project to open up the Editor.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add in open data</h3>

<p>Just as you will learn in the Crash Course I mentioned above, we will add in a new layer of data. For the sake of this example, we will select the urban city data.</p>

<p>Click Add Layer, at the top right. Once the Add layer model pops up, click Browse. In Browse, click MapBox.</p>

<p>Once in MapBox, click to mapbox-geodata / natural-earth-1.4.0 / cultural / 10m-populated-places.zip. Then click done and save.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Find the data to style</h3>

<p>From here, you can style anything from the countries you can see, to the data that you just loaded in. For the sake of simplicity, we will make a selector on the cities we loaded in and differentiate them by population.</p>

<p>For more specific selectors, you can go to the CartoCSS documentation.</p>

<h3>Step 4.5: Code example</h3>

<p>After looking at the Layer&#8217;s &#8220;Feature&#8221; data, I found the data column <strong>POP_MIN</strong> that I would like to target.</p>

<p>The proper syntax for selecting a data attribute is similar to CSS. I will use <code>#10mpopulatedplaces{}</code> to make a selector for the data we imported.</p>

<p>Second, I will made a distinction between the small, medium, and large cities with a conditional selector. The conditional selector should go onsite the one we created above. You can make something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#10mpopulatedplaces {
  marker-width:1;
  marker-fill-opacity: 0;
  marker-line-color:#ec9a14;
  marker-allow-overlap:true;

  [POP_MIN &lt;= 1200000] { marker-width:100;marker-opacity: 0.4; marker-line-width:1.0; }
  [POP_MIN &gt; 1200000]   { marker-width:400; marker-opacity: 0.1; }
  [POP_MIN &gt; 10000000]   { marker-width:700; marker-opacity: 0.5; marker-line-width:.3;}
</code></pre>

<p>This will make three different styles targeting cities with a minimum population smaller than or equal to 1,200,000, larger than 1,200,000 and larger than 10,000,000. The styles that I select are the marker <em>size</em>, <em>opacity</em>, and <em>border</em>. CartoCSS documentation explains there are a number of other styling features such as fill, glow, and much others.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Export</h3>

<p>From here, you have a map with some generic circles. You can make some additional styling choices to the land and ocean. If you want to make the purple map that I had, you can find the style.mss content <a href="https://gist.github.com/lkbgift/5163407">here</a></p>

<p>Go ahead and click Export to get the choices of different export formats. Personally, I like to screenshot the export screen, then modify the screenshot in Photoshop. I have found it looks more like the way I want it to. Otherwise, explore in PNG and set the dimensions.</p>

<h2>Learning More</h2>

<p>The above was a really basic instruction set. This doesn&#8217;t do justice to the capacity of TileMill, so I highly suggest that you go and follow the Crash Course provided by TileMill and experiment yourself.</p>

<p>If you are interested in digital maps, I highly suggest listening to the <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead/23">WebAhead podcast on Maps with Alex Barth</a>. This was the first time I learned about TileMill and MapBox.</p>

<h1>Using multiple icon fonts from Zurb</h1>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>The creators of Foundation, Zurb, provide useful tools for full-stack developers. One of their freely available tools are the Icon Fonts found <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons">here</a>. The fonts are free. There are four sets: general, enclosed, social, and accessibility.</p>

<p>Of the four sets, it is difficult to simply choose one. Personally, I took a couple icons from each set. Because Zurb sets up their font sets in SASS files, this becomes exceptionally easy.</p>

<p><em>This guide is for users of Foundation and SASS</em></p>

<h2>How to setup</h2>

<h3>1. Download</h3>

<p>First, download the fonts that you want from the Foundation Icons page. The link is here: <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons">http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Moving files</h3>

<p>Second, grab the files located in the <code>/sass</code> and <code>/fonts</code> directory. Move these two directories to your website&#8217;s main root directory. My home directory is setup like this:</p>

<pre><code>/
/index.html
/css/*.css
/css/*.scss
/css/[ONE-FONT-SET]/[scss-FILES]
/fonts/[FONTS-GO-HERE]
/images/
/scripts/
</code></pre>

<p>I have my SASS files and CSS files in the same directory. I create a separate directory in the <code>/css/</code> directory for each individual font <code>.scss</code> file set. Because I use SASS, I try to keep my working directories as organized as possible. I place the font files (<code>.eot</code>, <code>.svg</code>, <code>.tff</code>, <code>.woff</code>) into the <code>/fonts/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>3. Update Foundation Icon .scss files</h3>

<p>After your files are placed in their respective directories, you need to update the files paths declared in the files. Also, if you are using multiple fonts, then you need to update the CSS class names, so the fonts do not overwrite one another.</p>

<p>First, open the <code>_settings.scss</code> file for each font set. You should have something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$fontFileName: "../fonts/general_foundicons";
$fontName: "GeneralFoundicons";
$classPrefix: "foundicon-";

@mixin i-class($name,$pua) {
  .#{$classPrefix}#{$name}:before { 
    content: "\f#{$pua}";
  }
}

@mixin ie-class($name,$pua) {
  .#{$classPrefix}#{$name} { 
    *zoom: expression( this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = "1", this.innerHTML = "&amp;#xf#{$pua};"); 
  }
}

@mixin face {
  @font-face { 
    font-family: $fontName;
    src: url('#{$fontFileName}.eot');
    src: url('#{$fontFileName}.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('#{$fontFileName}.woff') format('woff'),
         url('#{$fontFileName}.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('#{$fontFileName}.svg##{$fontName}') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You need to change the first and third lines, respective to your own setup. The first line declares where you font files are located, respective to where you compiled .scss files appear. For me, my CSS files render in <code>/css/*</code>. To access the <code>/fonts/</code> directory, I use <code>../fonts/general_foundicons</code> to go up one directory and into <code>/fonts/</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using multiple fonts, you need to change the <code>$classPrefix</code> statement on the third time of <code>_settings.scss</code> to be unique. I change the name of my General Set from</p>

<pre><code>$classPrefix: "foundicon-";
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>$classPrefix: "foundicongen-";
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, I changed my accessibility, social, and enclosed sets respectively, by adding one three letters after <code>foundicon</code>.</p>

<h3>4. Using icons in webpage</h3>

<p>For this part, you can follow the directions on Zurb&#8217;s instructions. You need to find out the name of the font icon you want to declare. Then, using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag, set the class <code>foundicon-[icon]</code>, where [icon] is the name of the icon you want to declare.</p>

<p>In my case, because I am using multiple fonts, I needed to rename the class prefix above. Therefore, depending on the icon set I am pulling, I need to declare class that reflects the icon set.</p>

<p>For example, if I want the globe icon from the General Icons set, I will declare:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;i class="foundicongen-globe"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will appropriately pull the Globe icon associated with the General Icon set.</p>

<h3>5. Style Away!</h3>

<p>Again, just as the Zurb page says, you can now freely use CSS techniques to manipulate the icons. You can change colors, add triggers (hover, focus, active), as well as set animations using CSS3.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Fix from &#8221;<a href="http://theme.fm/2011/08/tutorial-deploying-wordpress-with-capistrano-2082/">Tutorial: Deploying WordPress with Capistrano</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://theme.fm/author/kovshenin/">Konstantin Kovshenin</a></h1>

<p>I was using the three blog posts by <a href="http://theme.fm/author/kovshenin/">Konstantin Kovshenin</a> about using Capistrano with WordPress. The blog post tutorials were written in 2011.</p>

<p>I kept having issues with the symlink code used in the post. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace :myproject do
    task :symlink, :roles =&gt; :app do
        run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/uploads #{release_path}/application/wp-content/uploads"
    end
end

after "deploy:symlink", "myproject:symlink" 
</code></pre>

<h2>Problem: Tasks not being executed on <code>cap deploy</code></h2>

<p>Not having a Ruby background, I couldn&#8217;t easily debug the situation. To keep it short, every time I <code>cap deploy</code> the commands in the <code>:myproject</code> would not execute.</p>

<p>I believe the newest Capistrano no longer uses the <code>"deploy:symlink"</code> as a valid trigger. Therefore, the snippet originally provided was not working.</p>

<h2>Solution: Change trigger</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not a fancy outcome, but I changed the line:</p>

<pre><code>after "deploy:symlink", "myproject:symlink"
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>after "deploy", "myproject:symlink"
</code></pre>

<p>Now my symlink is run correctly and I am able to see my tasks run when I <code>cap deploy</code>.</p>

<p><strong>This is a fix to issues I found in Tutorial: Deploying WordPress with Capistrano](http://theme.fm/2011/08/tutorial-deploying-wordpress-with-capistrano-2082/)</strong></p>
