			Jason Goldberg at NYU Startup Week Keynote</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>Upcoming blog post about professional WordPress development and some of the tools that can help your workflow. Also, I&#8217;ll start writing a weekly article on how to learn Javascript. A few of the upcoming articles will be about Test Driven Development, using jQuery, common Javascript design patterns, as well as many more.</em></p>

<h1>Fab.com CEO Jason Goldberg</h1>

<p>Jason Goldberg came to NYU&#8217;s Startup week this week to speak with <a href="http://penenberg.com/">Adam Penenberg</a>. Penenberg led Goldberg through his entrepreneurial path from college dropout to CEO. Goldberg&#8217;s success and ongoing journey encourages eager adventurers like myself. A few points from Goldberg:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s worth pursuing what you believe is meaningful, even if it means dropping out of school (twice).</li>
<li>Find the one thing you are particularly good at and focus on it.</li>
<li>Find a partner who you admire.</li>
<li>Took on foreign competition by acquiring companies with strong teams in target countries.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t outsource. Make partnerships.</li>
<li>Investing in customers is more important than short-term revenue.</li>
</ol>


<h2>It&#8217;s worth pursuing what you believe is meaningful, even if it means dropping out of school (twice).</h2>

<p>Goldberg was born in Rockville, Maryland (followed by a single cheer in the audience) and went Emeryville for his bachelors degree. He dropped out of college in 91&#8217; to work on Bill Clintons presidential campaign. Believed in Clinton before he was the Democratic nominee, but saw the potential behind Clinton&#8217;s cause. His first volunteer position was to &#8220;drive around the wife&#8221; when she came to visit Atlanta. Ended up spending six and a half years in the Whitehouse in the economic council with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_Bowles#The_Clinton_years">Erskine Bowles</a>. By 1998, he was a completely different person (joking about weighing 185 pounds) and worked 7 days a week.</p>

<p>To take a break, he decided to go to business school at Stanford. While at Stanford, received a call from Bowles under the lines of (cue southern drawl) &#8220;I just put 50 million dollars in a company, but don&#8217;t know what they do. Can you find out for me?&#8221;. Left Stanford mid-degree to join the startup Bowles invested into and began the startup culture of the dot-com era. This is where he saw excess and understood the importance of a business model. He also learned this is where you invest in people that you know.</p>

<p>Following the dot com bubble&#8217;s burst, he moved to AOL Time Warner, right after the merger. He did strategy work but knew he was more interested in operations and management. He also knew that he was much more focused on user experience and moved to T-Mobile, where he worked on their first hotspot network. This was his first &#8220;big win&#8221; in his career. After finishing his project, the T-mobile CEO said &#8220;you can do whatever you want&#8221;. Shortly after, Goldberg pursued his own company.</p>

<h2>Find the one thing you are particularly good at and focus on it.</h2>

<p>For Goldberg, he knew his talent was in User Experience. Rather than being stuck micromanaging every part of his own company, he wanted to focus on the part that he knew best. His past projects were always recognized comparatively as the best user experiences. Rather than being caught up in all parts of the business, he wanted to lead the thing he knew best: User Experience. This is exactly what he did.</p>

<p>Goldberg&#8217;s first company in 2003 was a job-centered social network called Jobster. He noticed that the best hires at his companies were the friends of existing effective employees. Jobster was mean to help hiring &#8220;someone who knew someone who knew someone else&#8221;. The idea that good people knew good people that you should hire, resulted in a social network before its time. LinkedIn, coming a year later, approached the same space through creating a network. Jobster approached it by creating the tools that a company could use to tap a network.</p>

<p>Jobster had good ideas, but Goldberg felt he &#8220;ran too fast&#8221;. Instead of focusing on the one thing that he knew he was good at, he was involved in everything else. By doing everything, he got nothing done. Through the process he learned if he started another company, he would focus on being the project manager. Sadly, his next project was with Microsoft developers on a Microsoft development cycle. The one-year development cycle didn&#8217;t work for the internet.</p>

<p>When Facebook launched, he saw how apps were launching with millions of downloads going viral. Discovering an app making use of the emerging social-graph, he contacted the developers asking to &#8220;buy your company&#8221;. He discovered the app was built by two engineers in India and couldn&#8217;t even keep their servers running because of the traffic they received. As a result, he hired them to work at Jobster and built a product in four weeks that was better than anything the company had built before.</p>

<p>His new product enabled a very simple aggregate of the people in your social network circle. Goldberg related it to Facebook&#8217;s News Feed, before it existed. The focus was helping people discover news, just the way he was interested in discovering the news. The product was rolling out right before the election cycle and in under a year had several million users. The company sold in fourth quarter to a European social network, Zing.</p>

<h2>Find a partner who you admire.</h2>

<p>Goldberg moved to work in Germany to work on Zing, where he missed his boyfriend. This led him to decide on building a social network for gay men. The idea was developed with Bradford Shellhammer, who Goldberg had met years before outside a nightclub at 2am. Goldberg stayed friends with Shellhammer through mutual respect for one another. He felt Shellhammer was one of the most creative people he has ever met. &#8220;Bradford brought color to peoples lives.&#8221; To add, Shellhammer was showcased in Times magazine, twice.</p>

<p>The first idea of Fabulous was well timed with the trend for a new gay culture. Goldberg was confident in building a new product. Fabulous was &#8220;Gay foursquare meets gay trip advisor meets gay deal of the day&#8221;. Goldberg saw his relationships with Shellhammer as &#8220;Im a geek and your a gay&#8221; so we should do something. He knew he could build an amazing user experience and he had complete faith in the style that Shellhammer would produce.</p>

<p>In 2010, the two decided they would leverage their community to start selling stuff. On paper the idea for Fabulous looked perfect, but it wasn&#8217;t taking off. The mainstreaming of gay culture made a gay app less deeded. Glee, Modern Family, Grindr and all these &#8220;things&#8221; started coming up. Goldberg states, &#8220;even Facebook turned gay&#8221;. Seeing that the only successful communities were being based around sex, he wan&#8217;t to shift into selling stuff.</p>

<p>The idea for Fab took off during a dinner with Shellhammer. After three bottles of wine at the Market Village, they decided they were not leaving until they figured out what they were doing next. They liked working together, recognized the unique talents they brought together, and both wanted to work on &#8220;design&#8221;. Using Shellhammer&#8217;s taste, Goldberg suggested &#8220;lets build a business around your tastes and sensibilities to the world&#8221;.</p>

<p>Shortly after the decision, they told their Board of Directors a plan to shutdown the existing website and move ahead with their new idea. Note, they had no idea what they were going to do and were clear with their investors that they could step out and get their money back if they wanted.</p>

			Internet Browsers With Chinese Characteristics</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h2>Being in China</h2>

<p>The ex-patriots in China are very aware of the internet restrictions. Aka, internet with Chinese characteristics. It’s hard to explain to others what it’s like behind the Great Firewall. No facebook, no NY Times, and the sense of consistency. Beyond the occasional officially-unofficial media blackouts, most of the world doesn&#8217;t think about what the internet is like in China, even though there are more internet users in China than there are citizens of the United States. <a href="http://j.mp/12wZ7mL">apira.org</a></p>

<p>The censorship is secondary to considerations of the internet for web developers targeting Chinese users. In China, Internet Explorer 6 was king for far too long. The fallout from its history is obvious for web developers from the West. Like myself, China facing websites do not have the luxury of ignoring &#8220;obsolete&#8221; users. In a country where there are over 250 million Internet Explorer users, China facing websites consider an incredibly aggressive browser ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Battle against the obsolete</h2>

<p>There have, however, been enormous improvements in browser technologies recently. Two years ago IE6 had a 60% market share in China (<a href="http://j.mp/13HOpZG">w3.org</a>. Today, the wonderful website <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">IE6CountDown</a> states IE6 is a little more than 25% of the Chinese internet user population.</p>

<p>The problem with IE6 is not one of ignorance. IE6’s prior domination of the Chinese browser-share was the result of China’s piracy ecosystem. Remember the Windows XP system updates? If you remember correctly, only authorized editions of Windows XP are allowed to make those system updates. Because Chinese street markets sell a lot of &#8220;low-cost&#8221; software (aka, pirated software), a lot of Chinese computers can’t get official system updates. Old computers without system updates are unable to upgrade from their original IE6 browser.</p>

<p>Adding insult to injury, Chinese web developers target the IE6 browsers. Jerry Jinks from <a href="http://www.maxthon.com/about-us/">Maxthon</a> (a Chinese web browser provider) elegantly <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2012/06/interview_huawei_maxthon_qihoo.html">explained</a> the IE6 problem: &#8220;There&#8217;s a vicious cycle around IE6 in China: users keep using it because sites are designed for IE6, and people build sites for IE6 because users stay with it.&#8221; By having a market that depends on IE6, web developers can continue buildings for obsolete systems. Table based layouts, Dreamweaver WYSIWYG markup, and browser hacks litter Chinese websites.</p>

<p>Although the problem is large, the problem has not gone unaddressed. Microsoft partnered with Chinese anti-virus and internet browser company Qihoo 360 to systematically eliminate IE6. The partnership allowed Qihoo to make upgrades to the default browser on Windows XP systems from IE6 to IE8. Because Qihoo markets itself as a “security solution,” users recognize the need to download and install the new software. While users feel they are more secure, Qihoo is really just another web browser.</p>

<p>Qihoo’s browser is based on a Microsoft browser framework called Trident. Trident, like Webkit, is a rendering engine which allows browser makers to have a solid starting point. Rather than rewriting a complete browser engine, browser developers can start from solid footing to customize the user experience, rather than the rendering engine. For reasons related to China’s interest in Microsoft products, Trident has been very popular.</p>

<p>Two of the largest China based browsers, Qihoo and Maxthon, use Trident (<a href="http://j.mp/15A73RR">sec.gov</a>). Trident was developed by Microsoft to server as a web rendering engine for applications accessing web pages. Trident leverages parts of Internet Explorer, Webkit, and Chrome for various tasks. Interestingly enough, although Trident continues to develop today, the versions in Qihoo and Maxthon are dependent on IE8. Although the Chinese markets are moving off IE6, they are still using IE8. For web developers, that means no media-queries, no CSS3&#8230;</p>

<p>For browser developers, using an existing rendering engines makes sense. The W3C and WHATWG have both been emphasizing the need for browser consistency. After the intensional varriance of Netscape and Internet Explorer in the 90’s, browsers started keeping to a set of rules. For new browsers developing, like Qihoo and Maxthon, using existing rendering engines allows the companies to focus on other features. For example, Qihoo focuses on firewall and virus scanning tools. Compared to other alternative browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, marketing based on the value of security has worked in Qihoo’s favor.</p>

<h2>Different priorities</h2>

<p>China&#8217;s web infrastructure growth has impressed me with its high internet penetration rates, but the websites themselves are not so innovative. To be fair to Chinese web developers, though, there is a different focus on developing for the web in China. Users here don&#8217;t want the newest technologies just because they are available. Again, as <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2012/06/interview_huawei_maxthon_qihoo.html">Jerry Jinks stated</a>, &#8220;They just want to see the Web&#8221;. The issue is along the expectations behind the Chinese internet consumers. Just because there are a lot of users, does not by any means result in high quality websites.</p>

<p>US web users are spoiled. If a website isn’t pretty or doesn&#8217;t load in a set period of time, they don’t want to visit the site. There is research that proves this (<a href="http://j.mp/Yf5WRn">seomoz</a>. Chinese users browsing habits are still developing. Standing on a train and looking over people&#8217;s shoulders, you see people reading websites rendered without any CSS.</p>

<p>Importance is not widely placed on web standards. Beautiful, shiny, CSS3-filled, progressively enhanced HTML5 websites are few in China. In fact, there are some web practices that are simply painful to watch (<a href="http://zombo.com/">queue Flash splash page leading to table layout website</a>). The need for old browser coverage results in the sheer inability to embrace innovative technologies. It doesn&#8217;t help that new libraries and frameworks are proudly dropping support for IE6 and IE7.
Ironically, in a place where old browsers are such a problem, I have yet to see a Chinese progressively enhance or gracefully degrading website. When Modernizer and polyfills are being developed for the exact purpose of serving the worlds edge case browsers, I don&#8217;t see a wide range of Chinese adopters.</p>

<p>There’s a plethora of digital and printed content about web development available in English, but rarely to I see the same kind of material circulated in China. While I don&#8217;t know if an internet growth market would be interested in the concepts of web standards, it could benefit from access to the discussions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There is something to be said for the recent popularization of dropping support for old browsers. Undeniably, costs to develop for old browsers can be unreasonably high and unmanageable. Still, it should be considered that dropping support for old browsers entails dropping support for huge parts of the world. I am certain that in the coming years, China won&#8217;t be as affected by this issue. Mobile browsers are exponentially claiming internet browser marketshare. For mobile devices alone, heads are turning toward standards and HTML5.</p>

<p>Until then, don&#8217;t forget about the products Made in China and good luck finding stylish Chinese system fonts.</p>

			Basic TileMill: Making Beautiful Maps</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="https://forrst-live.s3.amazonaws.com/multiposts/images/39039/mega.png?1363124354" alt="Using TileMill" /></p>

<h1>TileMill makes beautiful maps</h1>

<p><a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> is a downloadable program that allows you to make beautiful maps. The software is developed by <a href="http://mapbox.com/">MapBox</a>, a company that provides OpenSource maps as a service.</p>

<p>TileMill is a basic GUI for skinning GIS data. Using a CSS like language, called <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/">CartoCSS</a>, users can modify and add visual elements. CartoCSS provides conditional logic, allowing styles to target specific segments of data.</p>

<p>An example of segmented data styling is in open data regarding city populations. Using the CartoCSS, you can render a circle on all of the cities in the world. Using conditional logic, you can make the circle bigger or smaller based on the population of the city.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>To get an introduction to TileMill, I suggest going through the <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/">Crash Course</a> provided by MapBox. The crash course will show you how to load in external data sets, provide conditional styling, and export your map (or upload it online).</p>

<h2>Quick Lesson</h2>

<p>I <a href="http://forrst.com/posts/Beautiful_maps_with_CSS_and_open_data-FRM">showcased a map</a> I made for Acquinity Interactive on <a href="http://forrst.com">Forrst</a> this week. On it, I showed the working files of the TileMill map I created. One of the users requested that I explain how to make something like this.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Download and install</h3>

<p>I won&#8217;t go into detail. Get the program <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">here</a> and install it.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Start a new project</h3>

<p>Click Projects > New project. Set a filename. Make sure the &#8220;Default data&#8221; box is check. Then click Add. Click the newly created project to open up the Editor.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Add in open data</h3>

<p>Just as you will learn in the Crash Course I mentioned above, we will add in a new layer of data. For the sake of this example, we will select the urban city data.</p>

<p>Click Add Layer, at the top right. Once the Add layer model pops up, click Browse. In Browse, click MapBox.</p>

<p>Once in MapBox, click to mapbox-geodata / natural-earth-1.4.0 / cultural / 10m-populated-places.zip. Then click done and save.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Find the data to style</h3>

<p>From here, you can style anything from the countries you can see, to the data that you just loaded in. For the sake of simplicity, we will make a selector on the cities we loaded in and differentiate them by population.</p>

<p>For more specific selectors, you can go to the CartoCSS documentation.</p>

<h3>Step 4.5: Code example</h3>

<p>After looking at the Layer&#8217;s &#8220;Feature&#8221; data, I found the data column <strong>POP_MIN</strong> that I would like to target.</p>

<p>The proper syntax for selecting a data attribute is similar to CSS. I will use <code>#10mpopulatedplaces{}</code> to make a selector for the data we imported.</p>

<p>Second, I will made a distinction between the small, medium, and large cities with a conditional selector. The conditional selector should go onsite the one we created above. You can make something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#10mpopulatedplaces {
  marker-width:1;
  marker-fill-opacity: 0;
  marker-line-color:#ec9a14;
  marker-allow-overlap:true;

  [POP_MIN &lt;= 1200000] { marker-width:100;marker-opacity: 0.4; marker-line-width:1.0; }
  [POP_MIN &gt; 1200000]   { marker-width:400; marker-opacity: 0.1; }
  [POP_MIN &gt; 10000000]   { marker-width:700; marker-opacity: 0.5; marker-line-width:.3;}
</code></pre>

<p>This will make three different styles targeting cities with a minimum population smaller than or equal to 1,200,000, larger than 1,200,000 and larger than 10,000,000. The styles that I select are the marker <em>size</em>, <em>opacity</em>, and <em>border</em>. CartoCSS documentation explains there are a number of other styling features such as fill, glow, and much others.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Export</h3>

<p>From here, you have a map with some generic circles. You can make some additional styling choices to the land and ocean. If you want to make the purple map that I had, you can find the style.mss content <a href="https://gist.github.com/lkbgift/5163407">here</a></p>

<p>Go ahead and click Export to get the choices of different export formats. Personally, I like to screenshot the export screen, then modify the screenshot in Photoshop. I have found it looks more like the way I want it to. Otherwise, explore in PNG and set the dimensions.</p>

<h2>Learning More</h2>

<p>The above was a really basic instruction set. This doesn&#8217;t do justice to the capacity of TileMill, so I highly suggest that you go and follow the Crash Course provided by TileMill and experiment yourself.</p>

<p>If you are interested in digital maps, I highly suggest listening to the <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead/23">WebAhead podcast on Maps with Alex Barth</a>. This was the first time I learned about TileMill and MapBox.</p>

			Using Multiple Icon Fonts From Zurb</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://cdn.css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/set-zurb.jpg" alt="Zurb's Foundation Icons" /></p>

<h1>Using multiple icon fonts from Zurb</h1>

<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>The creators of Foundation, Zurb, provide useful tools for full-stack developers. One of their freely available tools are the Icon Fonts found <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons">here</a>. The fonts are free. There are four sets: general, enclosed, social, and accessibility.</p>

<p>Of the four sets, it is difficult to simply choose one. Personally, I took a couple icons from each set. Because Zurb sets up their font sets in SASS files, this becomes exceptionally easy.</p>

<p><em>This guide is for users of Foundation and SASS</em></p>

<h2>How to setup</h2>

<h3>1. Download</h3>

<p>First, download the fonts that you want from the Foundation Icons page. The link is here: <a href="http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons">http://www.zurb.com/playground/foundation-icons</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Moving files</h3>

<p>Second, grab the files located in the <code>/sass</code> and <code>/fonts</code> directory. Move these two directories to your website&#8217;s main root directory. My home directory is setup like this:</p>

<pre><code>/
/index.html
/css/*.css
/css/*.scss
/css/[ONE-FONT-SET]/[scss-FILES]
/fonts/[FONTS-GO-HERE]
/images/
/scripts/
</code></pre>

<p>I have my SASS files and CSS files in the same directory. I create a separate directory in the <code>/css/</code> directory for each individual font <code>.scss</code> file set. Because I use SASS, I try to keep my working directories as organized as possible. I place the font files (<code>.eot</code>, <code>.svg</code>, <code>.tff</code>, <code>.woff</code>) into the <code>/fonts/</code> directory.</p>

<h3>3. Update Foundation Icon .scss files</h3>

<p>After your files are placed in their respective directories, you need to update the files paths declared in the files. Also, if you are using multiple fonts, then you need to update the CSS class names, so the fonts do not overwrite one another.</p>

<p>First, open the <code>_settings.scss</code> file for each font set. You should have something that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>$fontFileName: "../fonts/general_foundicons";
$fontName: "GeneralFoundicons";
$classPrefix: "foundicon-";

@mixin i-class($name,$pua) {
  .#{$classPrefix}#{$name}:before { 
    content: "\f#{$pua}";
  }
}

@mixin ie-class($name,$pua) {
  .#{$classPrefix}#{$name} { 
    *zoom: expression( this.runtimeStyle['zoom'] = "1", this.innerHTML = "&amp;#xf#{$pua};"); 
  }
}

@mixin face {
  @font-face { 
    font-family: $fontName;
    src: url('#{$fontFileName}.eot');
    src: url('#{$fontFileName}.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('#{$fontFileName}.woff') format('woff'),
         url('#{$fontFileName}.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('#{$fontFileName}.svg##{$fontName}') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You need to change the first and third lines, respective to your own setup. The first line declares where you font files are located, respective to where you compiled .scss files appear. For me, my CSS files render in <code>/css/*</code>. To access the <code>/fonts/</code> directory, I use <code>../fonts/general_foundicons</code> to go up one directory and into <code>/fonts/</code>.</p>

<p>If you are using multiple fonts, you need to change the <code>$classPrefix</code> statement on the third time of <code>_settings.scss</code> to be unique. I change the name of my General Set from</p>

<pre><code>$classPrefix: "foundicon-";
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>$classPrefix: "foundicongen-";
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, I changed my accessibility, social, and enclosed sets respectively, by adding one three letters after <code>foundicon</code>.</p>

<h3>4. Using icons in webpage</h3>

<p>For this part, you can follow the directions on Zurb&#8217;s instructions. You need to find out the name of the font icon you want to declare. Then, using the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> tag, set the class <code>foundicon-[icon]</code>, where [icon] is the name of the icon you want to declare.</p>

<p>In my case, because I am using multiple fonts, I needed to rename the class prefix above. Therefore, depending on the icon set I am pulling, I need to declare class that reflects the icon set.</p>

<p>For example, if I want the globe icon from the General Icons set, I will declare:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;i class="foundicongen-globe"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This will appropriately pull the Globe icon associated with the General Icon set.</p>

<h3>5. Style Away!</h3>

<p>Again, just as the Zurb page says, you can now freely use CSS techniques to manipulate the icons. You can change colors, add triggers (hover, focus, active), as well as set animations using CSS3.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

			Deploying WordPress With Capistrano Symlink Issue Fix</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Fix from &#8221;<a href="http://theme.fm/2011/08/tutorial-deploying-wordpress-with-capistrano-2082/">Tutorial: Deploying WordPress with Capistrano</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://theme.fm/author/kovshenin/">Konstantin Kovshenin</a></h1>

<p>I was using the three blog posts by <a href="http://theme.fm/author/kovshenin/">Konstantin Kovshenin</a> about using Capistrano with WordPress. The blog post tutorials were written in 2011.</p>

<p>I kept having issues with the symlink code used in the post. The code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>namespace :myproject do
    task :symlink, :roles =&gt; :app do
        run "ln -nfs #{shared_path}/uploads #{release_path}/application/wp-content/uploads"
    end
end

after "deploy:symlink", "myproject:symlink" 
</code></pre>

<h2>Problem: Tasks not being executed on <code>cap deploy</code></h2>

<p>Not having a Ruby background, I couldn&#8217;t easily debug the situation. To keep it short, every time I <code>cap deploy</code> the commands in the <code>:myproject</code> would not execute.</p>

<p>I believe the newest Capistrano no longer uses the <code>"deploy:symlink"</code> as a valid trigger. Therefore, the snippet originally provided was not working.</p>

<h2>Solution: Change trigger</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not a fancy outcome, but I changed the line:</p>

<pre><code>after "deploy:symlink", "myproject:symlink"
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>after "deploy", "myproject:symlink"
</code></pre>

<p>Now my symlink is run correctly and I am able to see my tasks run when I <code>cap deploy</code>.</p>

<p><strong>This is a fix to issues I found in Tutorial: Deploying WordPress with Capistrano](http://theme.fm/2011/08/tutorial-deploying-wordpress-with-capistrano-2082/)</strong></p>

			WordPress Deployment Using Capistrano</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Acquinity Interactive hired me</h1>

<p>I was recently hired by a marketing company to help them rebrand their digital presence. While this word is loaded with meaning, they wanted me to help them make a new website. The process is allowing me to start a development process from the complete beginning. Most interestingly, Im able to do things the right way.</p>

<h2>Why WordPress?</h2>

<p>I decided to use WordPress as the framework for their website. As a company of more than 250 employees, they need something that can be easily managed by otherwise untrained individuals. A straightforward CMS like WordPress is perfect for this job.  For me, I prototype the website using Foundation from Zurb, then with the creative director, I find the right &#8220;style&#8221; of the website. Once we get past deciding the technical details, I can just go into WordPress and make page templates that fit out prototyped site. By using WordPress, I know that once I get past the html/css prototypes, I can translate the pages into php template files that will be populated from the administrative panel.</p>

<h2>Why Capistrano?</h2>

<p>This is a good question. People who think of WordPress either think of the SaaS version (wordpress.com) or blogs. Most people don&#8217;t consider it requiring a development process or a deployment strategy. Personally, I hate wasting time on things that don&#8217;t need to have time wasted on. I love to learn something new, but if I can find out how to automate a process, I&#8217;m going to take the initial time to set it up. By automating the deployment process, I know I can have consistent development environments.</p>

<p>Capistrano is a Ruby based package that runs SSH commands. Its largely used with Rails applications to manage various development environments (local/staging/production). Its great because at a touch of <code>cap deploy</code> you have your website up and running. Better yet, if you find out something broke, you just just <code>cap deploy:rollback</code>. In short, it&#8217;s pretty amazing because no longer do you need a designated &#8220;deployment&#8221; person. Instead, you can take time before your project begins to have the deployment strategy set up.</p>

<h2>Why do you need development environments?</h2>

<p>I won&#8217;t go to much into this because it&#8217;s one of the basic tenants of web development. Have a place where you develop (local), have a test environment where the site is as close to live without being live (testing), and have a separate place to have a autonomous production environment which will not be disrupted. One of the issues with these environments is that you have different files that you may be changing, but are not consistently updated.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t want to screw up a site when other people may be using it. In the worst case scenario, you have files that you are working on a live site. Maybe you use the WordPress code editor, or maybe your using an FTP program to just edit the files directly on the server. In this situation, if you have a boo-boo, but don&#8217;t know whats wrong, you could lose traffic and confuse users.</p>

<p>In a slightly better situation, you have a local development environment and a production server. This is pretty normal. You might make your changes to your WordPress theme via a local server. You make sure the files are working and the visuals render properly. Once you like the final product, you will push the updated files through FTP. If you are really good, you will update the files via SSH.</p>

<p>The first example (aka cowboy coding) is all bad. The second example is not so obvious for some people. To explain most basically, FTP is very slow and error prone. Its not impossible to use FTP for site management, but its very likely that batch uploads will result in significant failed files. Yes, you can always make sure the files work by looking through your log. The point is you want to find a solution that doesn&#8217;t have any problems.</p>

<h2>Enter Capistrano</h2>

<p>Capistrano lets you have your local environment mirrored in other places. You can set certain folders that are not mirrored (i.e. file uploads, config files, etc), so that your updates to the site are fast and targeted. Capistrano uses SSH and Git to create your extended servers. By setting up Capistrano, you just need to develop using basic version control methods. If you already use Git normally, Capistrano is perfect for you.</p>

<p>Setting up Capistrano is a bit difficult for non-Ruby developers (aka me). There is some syntax that takes getting used to, but once you figure out the gist, its a walk in the park. Theres nothing more fulfilling than working at something that seems so foreign and finally seeing it work.</p>

			Yeoman EADDRINUSE Error Fix</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>Yeoman</h1>

<p>I recently fell into the bandwagon of Yeoman. After spending time with Peepcode screencasts to deepen my understanding of jQuery, javascript and MVC frameworks, I decided TDD and Grunt were crucial to m y development process. Having people like Chris Coyer and Paul Irish on my radar made me finally fess up and get Yeoman running locally.</p>

<h2>Getting Running</h2>

<p>Issue with running Yeoman is initially my allergic reaction to automated terminal commands. I am not always fond of seeing foreign words run by my command line, but I try my best to understand what they are doing.</p>

<p>Grunt installs itself when you run <code>Yo Webapp</code>. Theres little you need to do to have working scaffolded application with TDD &#8216;infrastructure&#8217; in place (aka Mocha, Grunt, JSLint, etc). When you follow the directions from Yeoman.io, its easy to get the web app running</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>I started having problems when I wanted to run <code>Grunt server</code>. When I ran <code>Grunt</code> alone, the process ran without any problems. For some reason, when I tried to test the server, Grunt would hang up on LiveReload. Specifically, I got this message:</p>

<pre><code>Running "server" task

Running "clean:server" (clean) task

Running "coffee:dist" (coffee) task
&gt;&gt; Destination not written because compiled files were empty.

Running "compass:server" (compass) task
Nothing to compile. If you're trying to start a new project, you have left off the directory argument.
Run "compass -h" to get help.

Running "livereload-start" task
... Starting Livereload server on 35729 ...

... Uhoh. Got error listen EADDRINUSE ...
Error: listen EADDRINUSE
    at errnoException (net.js:769:11)
    at Server._listen2 (net.js:909:14)

    at Object.startLRServer (/Users/lkbogdonoff/sites/portfolio/node_modules/grunt-contrib-livereload/lib/utils.js:21:11)

    at Object.Task.start._running (/Users/lkbogdonoff/sites/portfolio/node_modules/grunt/lib/util/task.js:282:30)
    at Task.runTaskFn (/Users/lkbogdonoff/sites/portfolio/node_modules/grunt/lib/util/task.js:235:24)
</code></pre>

<p>I posted a bug report to the Yeoman Github repository <a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/938">here</a> and pinged <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresorhus</a>. Within a day, another user replied on the Github issue thread explaining he had the same issue. Similarly, Sindre Sorhus also pitched in to help.</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

<p>Eventually, I didn&#8217;t figure out what would solve the problem. I found a stop-gap measure which lets me continue running <code>grunt server</code> and have a local copy run without issues.</p>

<p>In Grunt.js, I needed to remove the line calling <code>livereload-start</code>. I did this by changing the grunt.task.run like this:</p>

<pre><code>grunt.registerTask('server', function (target) {
    if (target === 'dist') {
        return grunt.task.run(['build', 'open', 'connect:dist:keepalive']);
    }

    grunt.task.run([
        'clean:server',
        'coffee:dist',
        'compass:server',
      //'livereload-start',
        'connect:livereload',
        'open',
        'watch'
    ]);
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Even through I had googled portions of the error code in hopes of finding someone with a similar situation, there were no people with my exact situation. As a result, I thought about updating my Gems, Command-Line Tools and various brew packages. The Github issues response time was great. I&#8217;ll keep trying to get a better understanding of how to use Yeoman. For the time being it works!</p>

			Conclusion From the Soka Education Conference Paper</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>I wrote a paper titled &#8220;Soka Education and Digital Education Technologies: Massively Open Online Courses,&#8221; for the 2013 Soka Education Student Research Project conference. The following section is the conclusion.</em></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Soka education’s philosophical framework for teaching and learning is appropriate for the emerging to the newly emerging educational technology field. This papers goal was to help draw attention to a field that is quickly emerging with good intentions. The growth and social cause makes it attractive to both educators, entrepreneurs, and investors. Having such a great impact on the students, it must be carefully traversed. In references to evidence oriented progress, Makiguchi states:</p>

<blockquote><p>“We must strictly avoid following ideologies of uncertain origin that cannot be substantiated by actual proof-even if they may be the most time-honored tradition-and thereby sacrificing the precious lives of others and ourselves.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The education technologies too must be scrutinized to insure they are being implemented for the correct reasons. While MOOCs and other tools may benefit schools in reducing costs and increasing profits, the fundamental question should revolve around how they improve a students learning opportunity.</p>

<p>The digital technologies emerging in the education space are seeking to improve student-centered learning opportunities, but the educational technology space is not new. In the past five years, investors funding emerging private educational technology enterprises has quadrupled. These investments are spurring ventures such as MOOCs, but are still building profit-seeking entities. As a result, the driving forces behind Soka education are invaluable for reflecting on the purpose of education technology companies. Traditionally disruptive technology companies must be extremely careful in their disruption of existing educational markets. While emerging digital technologies can undoubtedly offer value to improving student experiences, many systems are already healthy.</p>

<p>The MOOC field is targeted at student-centeredness in a way that is inline with Soka Education. Just as the MOOCs themselves are not innately good or bad, their application must be continually considered. Companies like Udacity and Coursera are already holding classes that are eligible for actual college credit in American universities. The MOOCs are will help colleges reduce the cost of classes, expand course selection for students, and continue growing the discussion on the application of digital technology to education. The digital tools redefine “student-centeredness” by allow students to personalize their learning experiences in ways less prone to budget and institutional capacity.</p>

<h2>Future Research</h2>

<p>Future research should further analyze the following points from the perspective of Soka education: MOOC course rights, digital resource copyright clearance, hybrid teaching pedagogies, the usage of other multimedia tools for student learning, and the efficacy of video based learning materials. These topics could each be the basis for extensive research to further the field of student-centered education using digital technologies.</p>

			Digesting Reads | the Trial</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<h1>&#8220;The Trial&#8221; Kafka</h1>

<p><em>Starting off with the face that I needed some New York in my life. Digging the people, the architecture, the little coffee shops and busy subways.</em></p>

<h2>First two chapters.</h2>

<p>Kafka writes <strong>The Trial</strong> in a slight mysterious plot line that Im not used to reading. Reading the news and twitter streams has made me expect the core of the manner in a short burst. <strong>The Trial</strong> lays out a plot line by painting a clear picture and scene. The scene is filled with distinct emotional expression and tension, but there are no defined characters or causes. In a buddhist explanation, <strong>The Trial</strong> describes the world through effects, rather than causes.</p>

<h2>Home invasion</h2>

<p>The book begins with an abrupt awakening of the main character. Two men disrupt K. from his morning regime of breakfast and preparing for work. Instead, he is observed and kept from leaving his room. He is arrested.</p>

<p>The arrest is not explained to the reader or the main character and unfolds into the dangers of a hierarchical authority system. The figures arresting K. do not know why he is being arrested, but feel quite justified in their restriction of K.&#8217;s freedom. The invasion of privacy, disruption of personal space, and disregard for another&#8217;s humanity is seen in so many facets of society. The authority figures are not alone in their expression.</p>

<p>K., who hopes to reclaim his dignity, seeks answers. After being detained in his own home, he encounters the figure of higher command who personally interview the detainee. K., who continues seeking the cause for the injustices of the morning, encounters yet another response absent of reason. The invading figures freely roam K.&#8217;s home and declare their departure.</p>

<h2>Court appearance</h2>

<p>Forced to face his day without comprehending the complete background of the morning&#8217;s events, K. braves the rest of his day at work. Left only with a notion that he is expected to appear in court, he is forced to make assumptions as to his appearance date. Again, lacking all information to help understand the situation, K. decides to make his way to the courts on the first potential day court gathers.</p>

<p>Finding his way to the courthouse is no simple task. K. wanders the neighborhood and buildings near the courthouse, hoping to glimpse upon the place of his belonging. K. discovers the courthouse only too late and is forced to stand trial the moment of his arrival. Again, no explanation, he is placed in front of, what seems to be a divided courthouse.</p>

<p>Giving his all, K. argues for the injustices he is forced to undergo. Again, little understanding behind the disruption&#8217;s cause makes the argument one of unwarranted personal invasion.</p>

<h2>Realm of foreign rules</h2>

<p>Throughout K.&#8217;s series of events, the reader is left to wonder how easily the same events could happen to themselves. K. is a everyday well respected citizen. There is little that he did to provoke these events. More so, he seems to do everything in proper order to understand the dilemma, but is given no regard.</p>

<p>Replace K.&#8217;s story with any individual, young or old, and <strong>The Trial</strong> reflects their own experience in a judicial system. When expected to defend oneself in a realm of foreign rules, it matters little that there is any reason at all. The senselessness of the book&#8217;s plot captures closely the &#8220;in the moment&#8221; activity one is forced to experience in any mode of heavy jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The digestion of events is difficult in foreign systems of operation. More so, in moments of extreme consequence, the notion of clear reflection is nearly impossible.</p>
