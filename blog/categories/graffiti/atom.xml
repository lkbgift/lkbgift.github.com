    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Goals</h1>

<p>Im applying my graffiti interests toward my programming ability. Today I put together a brief python script to scrape a reputable graffiti writers forum. The scraper was designed to build a database of user names and images uploaded. My goal is two fold: learn about computer vision through analyzing graffiti pictures, develop insight into people&rsquo;s usage of the internet for distributing graffiti images. Beyond analysis, I would love to create a graffiti recomendation engine for aspiring graffiti artists. This engine would look at a person&rsquo;s &lsquo;style&rsquo; and give suggestions of other artists they may benefit from studying.# Scraping processI focused my first group of images scraped on New York city. I found the New York city forum thread in 12ozprophet.com. From here, I catered the scraper to tag posts and the images contained in the post. I created a unique ID for the images and the posts. Now that this has been completed, I may need to create a unique ID for the user names. As of now, this is not necessary.The scraper pulled from over 440,000 posts within the New York graffiti thread. From those posts, over 275,000 images were gathered. In a brief overview, I can tell that not all images are graffiti. Similarly, not all images are of paintings. There are tags, throw ups, pieces, and sketches. The images vary in quality and size. The dataset pulled from forum posts between 2009 to 2014. I&rsquo;m surprised to see how much camera quality and digital photography has changed in those few years.# Considering analysisIn the past few weeks, I have spent time understanding the application of statistical analysis on large data sets. Because I was working with small sets, I was able to use Microsoft Excel&rsquo;s functions. Beyond 100 data points, excel becomes noticeably sluggish in processing simple PivotTable tasks. I will use R and python libraries to process future analysis.I am reading various books I purchased in the past from Oreilly. The books topics are mainly around R, data analysis in Python, OpenCV, and machine learning. None of these topics are failiar to my background, or me so I have also picked up a basic book on linear algebra. I would like to finish the preliminary results from the first dataset by next week and move ahead with scraping the rest of 12ozprophet.# CodeThe code used to scrape is pasted below. The dataset will be made available in the near future. Note, while scraping 12ozprophet, the images are hosted on a large variety of websites. Different users primarily uploaded the images, so the image analysis should not create a large load on the forums. I do not believe I need to download the images for analysis, but if I do, I will likely use some a virtual machine cloud instance. Also, I am unfamiliar with the Python-way to write programs. I am primarily working with JavaScript and PHP. I have dove into Ruby on Rails, but am still dependent on the Gems and generators. As a result, much of my Python code is written with a JavaScript mentality.</p>

<p>Data from <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Grafitti-Information/gpwd-npar">https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Grafitti-Information/gpwd-npar</a></p>

<h1>NYC OpenData</h1>

<p>New York is one of the United States leading proponent for open data and government transparency. The city has stood by the Open Data movement from the beginning, initially gaining public acclaim during President Obama’s first term. The movement surrounds the practice of publicizing data collected by citizen funded departments. Data varies in content and form, from financial balance sheets to statistical records. In the past year, emphasis has been made to release information into machine-readable formats: sans-PDF, pro-JSON.</p>

<h1>CivicHacking</h1>

<p>Yesterday I received an email promoting the Code for America brigade supporting the “Code Across NYC” civic hackathon. The email, from <a href="http://chriswhong.com/local/finding-your-inner-civic-hacker/">Chris Whong</a>, promoted the spirit to getting involved with local communities through any means. Following Chris, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/betanyc/members/92647072/">Noel Hidalgo</a> shared a recently released <a href="http://nycopendata.tumblr.com/post/77071137659/doitt-recently-updated-and-automated-a-number-of">NYC OpenData</a> blog post on new real time datasets on New York city.</p>

<p>The data set topics ranged from medical history, farmer’s market records, and graffiti reports. All the sets were deemed &ldquo;real time&rdquo; and machine-readable. These data sets provide public access to rich repositories of information. Based on the availability, these will be the beginning of fresh new software applications based on consuming these datasets. Imagine the next farmer’s market notification mobile app or graffiti report location tool.</p>

<p>Individually, the data makes available the well-organized datasets. Even more exciting are the cross-reference opportunities. An interested party doesn&rsquo;t need to know how to program. Simply grab the CSV export copy of a preferred data set and get to some analysis. Immediately a PivotTable reference between data and category can provide interesting high-level comparisons. Looking at graffiti creation by date across boroughs shows the uneven reporting of graffiti incidents.</p>

<h1>Graffiti</h1>

<p>To start, I love graffiti. I love the notion of people finding and accessing places that have been deemed ‘dead’. I love the raw-ness of spray-paint. I love the culture, the people, even the drudgery associated to the painters. Most of all, I love how it represents a community of people who desire to express themselves publicly.</p>

<p>I am not one to argue that graffiti is not vandalism.mi strongly disagree with the painting of private property. I instead believe graffiti is the effect of a greater social culture associated with stemming the voice of individuals. I believe that large amounts of graffiti in an area are public signs for improvements.</p>

<p>There is a person doing the painting and that person is trying to say something. Maybe they have poor handwriting and a poor value system, but they are people to understand. Why do they get pleasure out of scrawling their moniker in public places? Why do they write on things that don’t belong to them? These questions make me interested in drilling into the available graffiti dataset.</p>

<p>I have a hypothesis that areas that are not central urban sectors with high amounts of graffiti could be improved by providing public art programs. I think most of the periphery communities with large amounts of graffiti are the result of youth between the ages of 12-18. I also believe these students have poor grades in school, are high risk for dropping out, and are likely exposed to drug use.</p>

<p>These assumptions aside, the graffiti is an expression of a societal problem. It&rsquo;s not a graffiti problem. It&rsquo;s. Community issue. It&rsquo;s an education issue. Graffiti is the signal, but the cause is larger.</p>

<h1>Action</h1>

<p>I have never been able to pinpoint or analyze graffiti from a statistical front. I have never seen a dataset like the one that NYC has made publicly available. I’m sure these sets have been stringently analyzed and reviewed by police and sanitation departments, I believe the information was most likely viewed from a cost-arrest standpoint. I believe the individuals who, like myself, love graffiti and see the value in its messaging will make great use of this information.</p>

<p>I will be looking at this information to seek out insight for potential public programs to stem these issues. Imagine, graffiti declines because citizens feel alternative ways to express themselves. Imagine, communities coming together to take responsibility for the visual composition of their neighborhood. Imagine, children and teenagers out on the street with a spray can, because they feel they are being heard.</p>
