<div class="entry-content"><p>What is the opposite of poverty?</p>

<p>My roommate and I had dinner tonight. We don&rsquo;t normally eat together and in the past we havn&rsquo;t spent time together. I feel a distance between the two of us that stems from my own perspectives subconcious judgements. I allow these personal options form, because they help me understand what I believe. Without reflecting on them, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to confidently recognize where I am and where I want to be.</p>

<p>Our discussion began with cultural observations about the future. I observe that global cultural shifts are drastically different from the past. The urbanized and rural communities are growing further apart. Urban centers are culturally similar around the world. Rural communities are the cultural unique reminence of the world.</p>

<p>I spent last year in China, Japan, Germany, Ecuador, and Peru. I traveled around the USA, from the California, New Mexico, Texas, New York, Massachusets, and Virgina. My short trips helped reinforce my opinions about global economic differences. The time in China and Ecuador were most influential.</p>

<p>Although I lived in China for nearly a year, the disparity in wealth was not uncomfortable. Occasionally, I saw an expensive car. Soon after, I would see a group of elder woman picking up recycling materials. The dycotomy of capital was obvious. I lived there, so I didnt take it to heart. By the end of my time, I felt at home. I found the places I liked to eat, the friends I spent time with, and the tasks to occupy my time. The tasks were evidently value creative. The comfort I experienced was my blindfold.</p>

<p>I visited Ecuador as an outsider. I attempted to reconvene with seven friends living in around the US. The trip was spontaneous and successfully executed. With little planning and no language competency, I spent two weeks Ecuador and Peru. My time was interupted by a brief cold I caught. The cold was the result of less than optimal sleeping conditions. The diet and deprived sleeping habits surely did not help.</p>

<p>Poverty was apparent in Ecuador. The country&rsquo;s infrustructure struggles as a whole. Primary gross domestic exports were fruits, flowers, and oil. The majority of the country exchanged labor for small payment. People&rsquo;s monthy salary was close to 300 dollars a month. A really good monthly salary was 600 for a young man. 600 dollars for 30 days. 300 dollars.</p>

<p>When I say poverty was apparent, I stress the state of life. People were full of agency. Commerce was busy, possibly even budding. People ran small businesses. Chain establishments existed in full force in Quito. Churchs, museums, entertainment opportunities, and youth culture were well developed. Still, poverty was apparent.</p>

<p>Meals were bland. Small piece of chicken, a bowl of soup, and rice was lunch. Amuoreso. Or something of that. Amuoreso was also dinner. Sometimes it was also breakfast. When I say it was each of these, I mean that diversity in food choices was small. Various options were avaliable, but not widely chosen because of cost. Perhaps the same can be said anywhere, but the lack of food selection was apparent.</p>

<p>Buses would regularly stop to let on traveling salesmen and woman. Bus rides included opportunities to purchase incense, fried pork loins, small meals, and bags of fruit. Looking back, the choice of foods was similar to rural China. Ecuador&rsquo;s distinguishing factor was the approach to selling. Sales persons would get on a moving bus and make an announecment in the front area. Based on their pitch, some riders would show interest, while most would not.</p>

<p>I was impacted by Ecuador most when I returned to the US. Upon arriving in the Newerk airport and taking the metro into New York, I recovered from my cold. Once arriving into the city, I was immediately approached by numerous homeless persons asking for money. No more than 12 hours before, I was in a country where even the poorest people sought honest ways to earn a living. In New York, I felt like the poorest of the rich did not seek a geographically equivilent means.</p>

<p>The opposite of poverty is justice. Daisaku Ikeda states this in numerous occasions within his speeches and dialogues with world leaders. Justice in economic opportunity. Justice in opportunity to experience the world. Justice in personal judgement.</p>

<p>I stress that the people I met in China and Ecuador had agency. Especially those from less affluent communities. Reflecting, I may even say that those from wealthier countries were less aware of their own agency to make change in the world as a whole. They instead frequented the thoughts of what they could not do. This was not something I saw in the youth of other places. Perhaps this is a negative consequence of being provided so much opportunity.</p>

<p>In anycase, my interest in the startup space or the industries revolving around educating people is justice. How can I better identify the root of my local and global communities issues. What injustice can I recognize and take action against? I must stress that this will not happen with intellectual masturbation. I do not seek fame, wealth, or power. I desire to create value.</p>
